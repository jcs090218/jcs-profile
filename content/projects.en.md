data-balloon-pos="up">🔗</span>):
Forked from [ad-m/github-push-action](https://github.com/ad-m/github-push-action), this fork includes the rebase option tailored for my automation workflows.
- [setup-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/setup-emacs) (Summer 2022):
[Github action][GHA] which installs a given [Emacs][] version.
This project aims to replace [purcell/setup-emacs][] by combining the two [GitHub Actions][] — [purcell/setup-emacs][] and [setup-emacs-windows][] — into one.
As a result, it now supports all commonly used operating systems.

### 🛑 Abandoned projects (will never be finished)

<details class="my-details">
  <summary>See details</summary>

- [tree-sitter-actionscript](https://github.com/jcs090218/tree-sitter-actionscript) (Spring 2021):
[ActionScript][] grammar for [tree-sitter][].
[Rileran][] completed the project earlier — [Rileran/tree-sitter-actionscript](https://github.com/Rileran/tree-sitter-actionscript) — thus, there is no need to continue the project any further.
For the record, [Rileran][]'s project takes inspiration from my project!
- [work-time](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/work-time) (Spring 2021):
How long have you been working?
I'm uncertain about its current value, as it could potentially be substituted with [wakatime](https://wakatime.com/emacs) and [hammy.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/hammy.el).
- [organize-imports-python](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/organize-imports-python) (Spring 2021):
Automatically organize imports in [Python][] code.
No reason to create this package anymore due to the advent of the [Language Server Protocol][LSP].
- [vlc-player](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/vlc-player) (Winter 2019):
Play video using [VLC][].
I can't recall the precise reason for abandoning this. My best assumption is that [VLC][] doesn't support the necessary options for stopping the video, prompting me to opt for [ffmpeg][] instead.
- [JCSEgret][] (Winter 2018 <span aria-label="Professional work"
data-balloon-pos="up">💸</span>):
A library designed for efficient game production using the [Egret][] engine as its foundation.
The project was initiated during the course of work but is no longer in use as the [Egret][] engine became obsolete following their bankruptcy.
