## Hi, I am Jen-Chieh 👋

A software engineer who aims to evolve, innovate, and inspire through technology.

Previously, I was a Unity Developer at [Novaby][], working as a mobile full-stack engineer.
My responsibilities centered around [AR][] technology in conjunction with [Unity][]'s [AR Foundation][].

Prior to that, my experience includes working as a Software Engineer, primarily using [Unity][],
at various game companies such as [T-Nexus][], [imi tech][], [GameBarley][], etc.
My primary areas of focus were gameplay, system architecture, tools, and automation.

Outside of work, I've created over 200 tools (see [Projects][]) that people used and over 1 million downloads.
