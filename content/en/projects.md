, delivering exceptional performance, especially on legacy [Windows][] systems.

## Rust packages

- [flx-rs][jcs090218/flx-rs] (Winter 2021):
Rewrite [emacs-flx][] in [Rust][] for dynamic modules.
The original [emacs-flx][] were written in pure [Emacs Lisp][].

Therefore, this package was developed, leading to a speed increase ranging from 10x to 16x.
- [flxy-rs][] (Winter 2021):
Fast, character-based search library in [Rust][].
This represents my first attempt to rewrite [emacs-flx][] in [Rust][], which was not successful.
Although it remains usable, the results in terms of fuzzy matching were not as impressive as the original [emacs-flx][] algorithm.

## Technical utilities

- [minify-dir](https://github.com/jcs090218/node-minify-dir) (Spring 2019):

It was initially used with [lsp-grammarly][], but it became obsolete after the upstream [grammarly-language-server][] had adapted the official API.
- [reverse_shell](https://github.com/jcs090218/reverse_shell) (Spring 2019):
Reverse shell implemented in [Python][].

## Static site generators

- [setup-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/setup-emacs) (Summur 2022):
[Github action][GHA] which installs a given [Emacs][] version.
This project aims to replace [purcell/setup-emacs][] by combining the two [GitHub Actions][] — [purcell/setup-emacs][] and [setup-emacs-windows][] — into one.
As a result, it now supports all commonly used operating systems.
- [setup-eask](https://github.com/emacs-eask/setup-eask) (Spring 2022):

- [unity-license-activate](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-license-activate) (Fall 2021):
Activate [Unity][]'s personal license through [CLI][].
- [setup-emacs-windows][] (Fall 2020):
A [Github Action][GitHub Actions] that installs a specific [emacs][] version.
This project draws inspiration from [purcell/setup-emacs][] but is specifically dedicated to supporting legacy Windows systems.
- [package-bot](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/package-bot) (Spring 2020 – Fall 2020):
Review new package PRs on [MELPA][] automatically.
Requested by the community, refer to [melpa#6714](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/6714).
While it wasn't ultimately accepted, it propelled the community towards a better alternative — [melpazoid][].

## On-hiatus projects (might be finished someday)

- [aws-toolkit-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/aws-toolkit-emacs) (Winter 2023):
A plugin for interacting with AWS from Emacs editor.
- [jcs-lem](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-lem) (Summur 2023 – Present):

Prototype your game easily with component driven library built on top of Cocos Creator.
- [JCSUE][] (Fall 2017):
Quickly construct your game by utilizing multiple components and predefined default settings.
- [jcs-vim](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-vim) (Winter 2016):
My personal [vim][] configuration files.
This is my initial experience with [Vim][], and I'm interested in exploring [NeoVim][] in the future.

## Abandoned projects (will never be finished)

- [tree-sitter-actionscript](https://github.com/jcs090218/tree-sitter-actionscript) (Spring 2021):
[ActionScript][] grammar for [tree-sitter][].
[Rileran][] completed the project earlier — [Rileran/tree-sitter-actionscript](https://github.com/Rileran/tree-sitter-actionscript) — thus, there is no need to continue the project any further.
For the record, [Rileran][]'s project takes inspiration from my project!
- [work-time](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/work-time) (Spring 2021):
How long have you been working?
I'm uncertain about its current value, as it could potentially be substituted with [wakatime](https://wakatime.com/emacs) and [hammy.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/hammy.el).
- [organize-imports-python](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/organize-imports-python) (Spring 2021):
Automatically organize imports in [Python][] code.
No reason to create this package anymore due to the advent of the [Language Server Protocol][LSP].
- [vlc-player](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/vlc-player) (Winter 2019):
Play video using [VLC][].
I can't recall the precise reason for abandoning this. My best assumption is that [VLC][] doesn't support the necessary options for stopping the video, prompting me to opt for [ffmpeg][] instead.
- [JCSEgret][] (Winter 2018 💸):
A library designed for efficient game production using the [Egret][] engine as its foundation.
The project was initiated during the course of work but is no longer in use as the [Egret][] engine became obsolete following their bankruptcy.
