I have heard about people saying that writing a blog is a good idea. And 
here is it, I am going to write a development blog for myself. I have been 
coding for years and would like to share what I had been through and talk 
about more like what I think is significants to a programmer. What are the 
jobs and tasks to the programmer and what does programmer does?
