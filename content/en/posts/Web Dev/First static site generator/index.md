I'm recently hooked by the static site generator, hence I have decided to create
one for myself. Why not? The huge reason is that I could host the site using
the GitHub's static site hosting services, but the one I have previously created
in 2018 [API-Reference-Template](https://jcs090218.github.io/blog/2018/11/12/Legacy%20-%20%E8%88%8A%E6%96%87/API-Reference-Template%20-%20API%E5%8F%83%E8%80%83%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF/).
is server base, which is not generator base.

The static site generator isn't hard to create, the most valuable technology
is the frontend and UI/UX. However, I have already created the frontend for
my own use. The main task for me would just have to extract the server base
to generator base. I have also renamed the tool to [SiraDoc](https://github.com/SiraDoc/SiraDoc),
so then I'm able to use it for other sites as well! Just like the previous
website, yet a lot easier and more suitable for the GitHub Actions' environment!
