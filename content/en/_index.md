## Hi, I am Jen-Chieh 👋

Welcome to my site! I've created many kinds of
software in various fields. I know <b>25+</b> programming languages, and I
have over **5,000+** contributions on [GitHub][] and [GitLab][].
I used to code **8+** hours a day, and it has been <b>5</b> years 
non-stop (now **5+** hours a day). I've spent a tremendous amount of 
time on programming and software study. Just to show how much I love this
field! 😊

In my experience, I was either a programming lead, technical consultant,
or senior software engineer. But unfortunately, I don't have enough
experience with management roles. One of my goals is to get better at
management roles (if I ever get a chance). Other than that, I would love
to continue my computer journey (there are still so many things to
learn)!
