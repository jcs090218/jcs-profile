A few weeks ago, I suddenly had the idea to calculate how much time I had spent on programming (including learning).
This led to some reflections. The calculation formula is as follows.

<!-- more -->

> Average hours per day Ã— Number of days in a year Ã— Total number of years

I started programming in the spring of 2013 and decided to fully commit to it in 2014.
On average, I spend between 5 and 16 hours a day coding, non-stop, including weekends.
My time is easy to calculate because, aside from specific times when I go out,
I spend most of my time coding, except for eating, sleeping, and other necessities.
Iâ€™ve always had trouble sleeping, which means I donâ€™t sleep much during the day,
and often donâ€™t sleep at all. So I often end up coding for over 16 hours
(the longest stretch was probably over 36 hours). ðŸ¤”
This is actually quite painful for me, but I wonâ€™t go into detail hereâ€”I just want to record how much time Iâ€™ve spent.  

Letâ€™s start calculating:  

```
Upper limit: 365 * 12 * 16 = 70,080 (hours)  
Average: 365 * 12 * ((16 + 5) / 2) = 45,990 (hours)  
Lower limit: 365 * 12 * 5 = 21,900 (hours)

Average of upper and lower limits: (21,900 + 70,080) / 2 = 46,350 (hours)
```

Although my average is roughly **40,000** hours, I feel it should be between **50,000** and **60,000**.
This is mainly because 5 hours a day is the absolute minimum; typically, 10 hours is the most common amount of time spent.

I once heard that if you invest over 100 hours in the same thing, youâ€™ve already surpassed 80% of people.
So what does investing 50,000 hours mean? Looking back, I realize Iâ€™ve come so farâ€¦ Itâ€™s truly awe-inspiring!
