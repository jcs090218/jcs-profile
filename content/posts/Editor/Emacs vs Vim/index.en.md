Precisely that I am neither an Emacs nor Vim expert. I am 
just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just 
amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my
[Emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs)
and
[Vim](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-vim)
repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold 
onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there 
are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid 
changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am 
not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge 
either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs.

Lead to the conclusion; I use Emacs more often than Vim. 
Before Vim users left the website, I would like to hold 
onto the basis, why I chose Emacs for my most frequently 
used text editor. First and foremost, I organized the editor 
users into two groups. Base on my own experiences, people 
who use Emacs are most likely work in the software development 
industry. On the other hand, the majority of Vim users works 
either in cybersecurity or a free hacker. The reasons are pretty 
much straightforward, as a software engineer, I would much 
appreciate Emacs' design. Emacs' architecture brings a lot more 
spaces and flexibilities to the software development workflow, 
and it maximizes the changing possibilities to the software 
engineer. Most of the software development is most likely to 
stay in a program that could likeliest achieve most of the 
tasks. Does it sound familiar to you? Yes, it is just another 
way of saying the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Of 
course, Vim could possibly do what Emacs does, extends to Vim's 
original design, I found that conflict Vim is an editor design 
for fast editing file in terminal. Comparing the two editors, 
Emacs had been built the way what software developer wants; Vim 
would most likely lose in this battle on this aspect. Vice versa, 
Vim are very popular to those who do not need an IDE to do their 
job and often require to exit text editor to jump to other 
software, do not even argues that Vim is moving towards to Emacs' 
design. Well, this leads to a problem that I could not find a 
good reason for having the conflict between the original design 
fast editing file in terminal and having multiple plugins or 
configurations in Vim. Though, if Vim starts moving towards to 
Emacs's design, does that mean Vim will lose the advantage on 
fast editing file in terminal? Many of Vim users complains Emacs 
was too big and cost so much of its' starting time, but now they 
want more plugins or configurations to their Vim settings? Emacs 
was designed between the lightweight text editor and heavyweight 
IDE, resulting Emacs could not going to be faster than Vim on the 
starting time, but it brings benefits to people who will like a 
'lightweight IDE', it retains most functionalities from any IDE, 
or even better, program yourself one!

If Emacs is that good why still not many people using it? The 
reason could be straightforward, I learned Emacs from scratch 
without any in-between supports like Spacemacs or Doom-emacs. 
I found that Emacs main website is not that friendly compared 
to other many sites. Plus, you could barely saw videos online 
that are about Emacs. Furthermore, compares to Vim's shortcuts 
design, Emacs have less cognitive shortcuts consequent people 
having a hard time learning Emacs' shortcuts comparing learning 
Vim's shortcuts. I would doubt anyone would likely to learn Emacs 
by having all these kind of challenges or difficulties in front 
of them. The learning curve is steep, and the cost of learning a 
new language for editing Emacs' configuration, which is EmacsLisp, 
could be an extra cost of time. If you notice programming language 
Lisp, then maybe this would be too obscure to you. In my case, I 
have no experience with programming language Lisp which leads me 
many hassles while learning EmacsLisp. I have been using Emacs 
for 4 years, and I still could not say that I am an expert to 
Emacs. I am not trying to, and I reckon developing routine is 
most likely imperative comparing to fixing the editor's 
configuration.

Lastly, I would say these are just my personal experiences; 
this means all of these are just my subjective thoughts. Some 
could be right, and some could be wrong. Emacs have its' own 
benefits, which Vim also does. I often use Vim editing files 
while I connect to the remote server. Indeed, one more advantage 
to Vim is that Vim is pre-installed on the most system. This 
lead to the conclusion that there is no best editor, the only 
wise man knows how to use the right tool on the right circumstance.
