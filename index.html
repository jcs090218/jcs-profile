Why do I say that? Let’s take a look:

This led to some reflections. The calculation formula is as follows.
Average hours per day × Number of days in a year × Total number of years
I started programming in the spring of 2013 and decided to fully commit to it in 2014. On average, I spend between 5 and 16 hours a day coding, non-stop, including weekends. My time is easy to calculate because, aside from specific times when I go out, I spend most of my time coding, except for eating, sleeping, and other necessities. I’ve always had trouble sleeping, which means I don’t sleep much during the day, and often don’t sleep at all. So I often end up coding for over 16 hours (the longest stretch was probably over 36 hours). 🤔 This is actually quite painful for me, but I won’t go into detail here—I just want to record how much time I’ve spent.

I’ve recently created a language server for Emacs Lisp. It’s interesting since people don’t think a language server for Emacs Lisp will provide any value. The statement is correct, and so do I. Emacs Lisp is only used within the Emacs editor, and Emacs itself is an Emacs Lisp interpreter. Therefore, a language server for Emacs Lisp would hardly bring any benefits to Emacs users.
But imagine you can code elisp (short for Emacs Lisp) outside of Emacs. That sounds interesting, huh? 🤔

April 30th, 2023. I have created my first language server that is actually useful to someone. I tried a language server a while back, but it was just an example server, so it’s not very useful, and it’s only for educational purposes.
The target language I chose to write is the ShaderLab language. ShaderLab is used in Unity Engine, so you can write custom shaders to stylize your game. Unlike regular programming languages, ShaderLab is much simpler to analyze, so the language server can respond to the client side.
