      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a record, a message from me to one of my ex-firned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in a dilemma, we humans are totally normal to be afraid
of it. This may be a process; afraid makes us strong and a much more
experienced people. Humans suppose to grow like that! So let it be!
Once you are afraid of something, don&amp;rsquo;t give up on trying it; think
about the issue, think as hard as you can, and try to resolve it!
Even if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the issue, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we are bad,
or the issue can&amp;rsquo;t be resolved in the later future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
