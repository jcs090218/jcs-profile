&lt;p&gt;I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my
college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have
much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I
decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years
and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity
Engine. In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying
&amp;ldquo;Data Structure&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Design Patterns&amp;rdquo;. What I presume that Design
Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built
by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a
lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires
that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment
have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET
Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Framework I have been working on</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of
our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts
work on the same project, and of course for game development students we
decide to make a AR game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always
not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game
industry. Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and
the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and
every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I
think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first
day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
