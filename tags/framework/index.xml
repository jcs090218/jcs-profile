      <description>JCSUnity Repo: https://github.com/jcs090218/JCSUnity
Acknowledge I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine.</description>

      <description>The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts work on the same project, and of course for game development students we decide to make a AR game.
Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game industry.</description>
