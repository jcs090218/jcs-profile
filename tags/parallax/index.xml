&lt;p&gt;This is the final project from the first class of web development from our
school. I joined this class as an elective class so I could have a peek of how
web development works. A list below is few highlights I would like to show from
this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Parallax Effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of Sound&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-parallax-effect&#34;&gt;üëÅÔ∏è Parallax Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most parallax effect I have seen aren&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfied to me. Generally they
will have a image at the back of other components then have it semi-stationary
to sit still at the place. In this project I would like to have a peek of how
CSS can do on 2016. Fortunately, after being learning animation system from
CSS I am for sure that the parallax effect I was to imagine are possible to
accomplish by just the CSS without using JavaScript. You can use the small
panel on the top left corner to navigate through the four pages from this website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
