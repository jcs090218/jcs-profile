      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up the thread, &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.unity.com/threads/my-disappointing-experience-using-unity-in-a-ci-pipeline.737678/&#34;&gt;My disappointing experience using Unity in a CI pipeline&lt;/a&gt;
is also the biggest obstacle for me as well. Personal license (free version) of
Unity will expire in a period of time depends on your region. The licensing system
from Unity is partially contradict to the CI/CD concept since it will force
the user to update their secret &lt;code&gt;UNITY_LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; on their GitHub Actions. (Notice
this does not apply to Plus/Pro users because they use a different licensing system!)
