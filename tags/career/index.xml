      <description>This is a rant about software engineering interviews and LeetCode.
🗯️ Preamble In 2024, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are grinding through LeetCode, aiming to break into the tech industry, drawn by the high salaries it offers.
🤔 What does LeetCode actually bring? LeetCode offers little more than these benefits:
Algorithm exercises and data structure knowledge Coding under pressure (Why though? Are we in a war zone now?) Passing coding interviews However, completing LeetCode doesn&amp;rsquo;t prove you&amp;rsquo;re a good software engineer.</description>

      <description>Recently, I came across a post on LinkedIn with the eye-catching title, “I think I’ve met a 10x engineer.” But as I read through the post, I started to have doubts. The author described how one of their colleagues had managed to fix a bunch of complex bugs in a short amount of time, which left them in awe. 🤔
But is that really what defines a 10x engineer? It brought back memories of my own experience as a so-called 10x engineer during my first job!</description>
