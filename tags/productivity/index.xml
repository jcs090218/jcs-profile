      <description>Productivity is topic that often is ignored by a lot programmer. I have seen a bunch of documents out there talking about algorithm and data structure, so I would like to post a topic about productivity for an advanced programmer or for the programmer who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly mean productivity in software development field? If you have seen my previous blog post &#39; Framework I have been working&amp;hellip; (Part 1) &amp;rsquo; and &#39; Framework I have been working&amp;hellip; (Part 2) &amp;lsquo;, then you might already know what I am going to write about for the rest of this article.</description>

      <description>The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts work on the same project, and of course for game development students we decide to make a AR game.
Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game industry.</description>
