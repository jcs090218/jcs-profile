      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m recently hooked by the static site generator, hence I have decided to create one for myself. Why not? The huge reason is that I could host the site using the GitHub&amp;rsquo;s static site hosting services, but the one I have previously created in 2018 API-Reference-Template. is server base, which is not generator base.
The static site generator isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to create, the most valuable technology is the frontend and UI/UX.</description>
