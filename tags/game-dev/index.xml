      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to write an article about communication
issues among game designers for quite some time now. This
issue has been simmering within the gaming industry for
some time and has been troubling me as well. As a programmer,
how can I communicate more smoothly with planners? This
article simply aims to document the situations I have
observed and, by the end, hopefully provide a better answer
to my own doubts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Timeline is placed in summer time, middle of July 2022, one of my friend
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/henrykuh&#34;&gt;@henrykuh&lt;/a&gt;) invited me to join the Game
Jam that he is going to host in Aug 2022. In the meantime, he has also
invited me to rejoin the community &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MatchWorkshop&#34;&gt;MatchWorkshop&lt;/a&gt;
, and become the headmaster of the Game Programming deparetment.
Therefore, this Game Jam is treated as an opportunity to collaborate
with other headmaster from other department in this community. 😕&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When get started to the game development, people will somehow face some sort
of situation that they will need to determine what they are going to master
to do in the development. The game development are mainly split into three
careers, which are &amp;lsquo;Art&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Design&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;Programming&amp;rsquo;. These three jobs are
very different to one the other. The best method to figure it out what you
want to do is to try all them all out one at a time. If your situation would
not allow you to do so,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
