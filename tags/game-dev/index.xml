      <description>&lt;p&gt;When get started to the game development, people will somehow face some sort
of situation that they will need to determine what they are going to master
to do in the development. The game development are mainly split into three
careers, which are &amp;lsquo;Art&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Design&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;Programming&amp;rsquo;. These three jobs are
very different to one the other. The best method to figure it out what you
want to do is to try all them all out one at a time. If your situation would
not allow you to do so,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
