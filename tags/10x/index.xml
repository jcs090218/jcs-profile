      <description>This took place during my very first job as a Unity software engineer at IMI Technology (which, by now, should have shut down). My primary responsibility was to develop board games.I joined the company mainly because it was conveniently close to home and the pay was reasonable, so I didn’t give it much thought. While some might find game development either intriguing or off-putting, this post isn’t about that industry. It’s purely a reflection of my own experience in software development.</description>
