      <description>Recently, I came across a post on LinkedIn with the eye-catching title, “I think I’ve met a 10x engineer.” But as I read through the post, I started to have doubts. The author described how one of their colleagues had managed to fix a bunch of complex bugs in a short amount of time, which left them in awe. 🤔
But is that really what defines a 10x engineer? It brought back memories of my own experience as a so-called 10x engineer during my first job!</description>
