      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across a post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkedin.com/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; with the eye-catching title, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve met a 10x engineer.‚Äù
But as I read through the post, I started to have doubts. The author described how one of their colleagues had
managed to fix a bunch of complex bugs in a short amount of time, which left them in awe. ü§î&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that really what defines a 10x engineer? It brought back memories of my own experience as a so-called 10x engineer during my &lt;strong&gt;first job&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
