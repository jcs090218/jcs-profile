              Productivity is topic that often is ignored by a
              lot programmer. I have seen a bunch of documents
              out there talking about algorithm and data structure,
              so I would like to post a topic about productivity
              for an advanced programmer or for the programmer
              who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly
              mean productivity in software development field? If
              you have seen my previous blog post '
              <a href="framework-i-have-been-working-1.html">
                Framework I have been working... (Part 1)
              </a>
              ' and '
              <a href="framework-i-have-been-working-2.html">
                Framework I have been working... (Part 2)
              </a>
              ', then you might already know what I am going
              to write about for the rest of this article.
            </p>

            <p>
              So what essentially methods that we could do to
              improve the productivity for ourselves as a software
              engineer? First of all, I would say build your tools.
              Anything that could speed up the development process
              will increase the productivity of the project. It
              sounds straightforward to make your tools or library,
              but when you start making it, it actually kind of
              hard to make. That I have heard of a lot of people
              asking me how to make a library for other people
              to use?
            </p>

            <p>
              Building a tool is hard and time-consuming. The
              first thing to make your tool is to have learned
              Design Pattern (I have already mentioned few books
              I recommend in my previous post - '
              <a href="framework-i-have-been-working-1.html">
                Framework I have been working... [Part 1]
              </a>
              '). Attention, learn design pattern is to learn
              how to build a better software architecture. Not
              to learn how to use a design pattern in your code!
              I have seen programmers use design pattern all the
              time and feel bad about it because they seem to be
              attempt to use design pattern instead of designing
              a software architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you have the skill and knowledge of design
              pattern. I would recommend seeing how other people
              build their tools on any open source platform.
              As everyone knows GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, etc.
              Designing tools are thinking about how to make
              other programmers feel comfortable when using
              your tool. Think what kind of params have to pass
              into this function? Think is this feature that is
              needed to be here/design?
