              Bubble tea can really hit the spot when it's
              done right. Tea is in so many forms just like
              coffee, but the deference to a differing flavor
              as opposed to the more rigid coffee flavor is
              quite splendid. Sharetea is near a world-famous
              university that constantly makes history, and this
              is the type of thing that can put such at greater
              ease. They have tables, but they do not have food.

            The regular HK milk tea is decent but I thought
            lacked a lot of flavor. I've gotten the same with
            an almond milk substitute, but it almost tasted
            like they subbed milk with water instead since
            the tea was so watery. But hopefully that was
            a one-off time, since other times have been fine.
          </p>

            Pearls are great! A bit on the overcooked soft
            side, but I like it that way.

            I have an issue with (most) food trucks.  I find
            them a combination of mediocre and overpriced.
            Thankfully SoH was neither.  The sandwich was
            around $8 but it was seriously like eating
            a New York burrito, it was pretty large.
          </p>

          <p><br/>
            While those things are important, what it comes
            down to was that it was ridiculously tasty.
            The Gyro Sub might have had the ingredients
            distributed a bit off but it was large, and
            delicious.  The meat was juicy and tender and
            it seemed like I kept finding chunks when I
            thought I'd got through it.  Lastly, the guys
            working the truck were nice.  Figuring they
            might have had to deal with a line of sots
            roaming by from nearby Icon and Cat Club, they
            were in pretty good spirits and willing to engage
            in some conversation.
          </p>


          <p><br/>
            Now I just need to find them again...

            the complementing textures of the agar and
            regular boba is definitely my favorite part.
            My friends who have also been here and had
            their different drinks (Okinawa, Original,
            etc.) have also enjoyed their drinks, and we've
            been to almost every single boba shop in SF
            (Plentea, Boba Guys, Sharetea, etc.) The price
            is pretty good for SF, and the service is fast
            and friendly. The lines aren't ridiculously long
            and the drinks are reasonable proportions.
            Would definitely recommend visiting!
          </p>

          <p><br/>
            However, as much as I like their boba, I would
            caution against the egg puffs/ waffles. I
            didn't take a picture, but it looks nothing
            like the pretty Instagram pictures or
            advertisements. I'm not exactly sure what
            happened, but the waffle was all broken up
            into little pieces and placed in a plastic cup.
            So, come here for the boba, not necessarily the food.

          <p><br/>
            The journey I took around Telegraph Avenue led me
            here. There is an excellent nightlife, not quite
            like Las Vegas, but wonderful without hesitation.
            The flavors are not always standard flavors that
            one has necessarily had before, with chocolate,
            vanilla and strawberry coming to mind. Accepting
            that, I ordered the High Mountain milk tea. It
            had a rich flavor as far as the tea, though perhaps
            I will try it without the tapioca pearls next
            time. The price of four dollars and the quality
            of the tea is good, but this is the San Francisco
            Bay Area after all, so there is more than serious
            competition. A little food might contribute, perhaps
            three good snacks. Everything there is a beverage
            at around four dollars.
