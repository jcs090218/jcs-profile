I have developed more than 150 elisp packages, and maintained over 200 packages (including my packages). It‚Äôs been a long journey staying in the Emacs community, I think it‚Äôs a good for me to slow myself down and step back a little and think what I‚Äôve accomplished through out these years.\nüí´ How I got into Emacs? Many people asked me this question, so I decided to reply it here.\nI first saw Emacs is at 2015, seeing Casey Muratori‚Äôs Handmade Hero series. I was blown away by how fast he can code in Emacs. How he can jump to other window and never leave the keyboard are all new to me.\nBut if I look at his configuration now, it‚Äôs actually not so great. He doesn‚Äôt use any third-party packages, so he has every defined in his own configuration file (~/.emacs file). The configuration can still be great without using those third-party packages, but it will only limit you and remake the wheel that maybe others have already done for you.\nBesides all of that, Casey is still a top-tier programmer I have known in my whole life. ‚ù§Ô∏è\nüí´ How much I‚Äôve put my time to Emacs? Like I‚Äôve mentioned above, trust me. I put in a lot of time to accomplish what I‚Äôve done for the Emacs community. If you search all my packages, I hold the most packages in MELPA. The time I have put kinda proof how much I love Emacs, but also how much I get disappointed with Emacs. üò•\nüí´ Why Emacs isn‚Äôt the worth my time anymore? First of all, there is nothing wrong with the Emacs‚Äô devel. They did a great job keeping Emacs alive, and I like their mentality and most of their technical decisions.\nFor me, the problem is the Elisp dev ecosystem (not the Emacs community itself; consider the Elisp dev ecosystem is the subset of the Emacs community). I appreciate people willing to contribute to Emacs, but I hate when they don‚Äôt consider their packages' cross-platform capability. Yes, I‚Äôm a Windows user; actually, I use all the most used systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows). I hate that when I try a package, it only works on a specific system (excluding packages that only rely on certain systems), but it is supposed to work on all systems. I feel terrible and frustrated because most of the Elisp dev does not care or does not care enough about the minority users (Windows users). Even some famous packages don‚Äôt work well on Windows, magit is slow, straight.el is slow, helm is slow, ivy is slow, projectile is broken, eping is broken, EAF is constatly broken, etc. I use over 500 packages in my configuration. I can list a ton of packages that have terrible cross-platform capability.\nBut are they all bad? Of course not. Most of the authors show patience and are willing to help you with the issue you have encountered. At least they have tried to solve these issues and provide a workaround, etc. Like magit has a GitHub issue (magit/#2982) that explicitly talking about the Windows performance. EAF authors and maintainers constantly respond to the users they have trouble with. These projects are amazing, and I appreciate them so much! But most of them aren‚Äôt like that‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, they either don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt care enough.\nIn the 2020 Emacs survey, Windows users are only 8%! I‚Äôve heard a lot of people claim I‚Äôm wrong. First of all, I‚Äôm in the minority; only God knows what we think. Second of all, I wish more than anyone I am wrong. I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm wrong or not. I want the UX to be improved!\nMany people complain about the OS (Windows), suggest using the WSL, etc. But that‚Äôs not the issue. Ignoring the issue is the issue! If you can‚Äôt solve the issue from another platform, don‚Äôt blame the platform. Blame yourself! There are no bad systems, only bad programmers (in this case).\nTo answer my own question, I am tired of being in the minority. It‚Äôs laborious and tedious. I‚Äôm tired of complaining to other Elisp dev. For people that know me, you know I hate to say all this. It‚Äôs sad and hopeless. Why bother? You might have known why I put so much time into Emacs. I‚Äôm only filling the gap between Unix-like systems and Windows. And yes, all my packages work across all platforms.\nüí´ Will I leave Emacs community? The short answer is no. I will most likely not going to develop more Emacs packages anymore; unless I really want to. But I will continue to maintain all the packages I‚Äôm currently maintaining since I will continue to use Emacs for my future work!\n‚öúÔ∏è Conclusion I didn‚Äôt know the article would be this long. It‚Äôs been a very long journey for me. I have learned a lot from this community and know many great people. I appreciate people who use my packages and those who do care the minority users like me.
