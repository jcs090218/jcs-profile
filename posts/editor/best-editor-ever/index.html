I decide to give both editor a try, and it turn out I chose Emacs over Vim.\nFirst, I would like to talk about why I chose Emacs over Vim. I think Emacs can do almost everything that Vim does. Vim stays cool he just wants to be a text editor and does not want to do something else. Emacs design the way that you could turn Emacs from text editor to something else. And of course, Emacs is not perfect. Emacs has few troubles doing something like you still need to use third-party software in order to run a package, and sometimes Emacs just froze when I am just trying to edit a text file. Emacs is just a right tool for me because I use to want a text editor that could edit any programming languages and do anything inside it. On the other hand, you might say that is gross to have a text editor do all kind of job for you. Why do not we just use another program instead of code in elisp and write your own functionality for Emacs? Is that even worth it?\nThe answer is really depend on who is using it. For me, I program in different programming languages; I would somehow need to use other text editor or IDE when I change to code in another programming language. For example, I code Java and C++ I would have to change from ‘Eclipse’/‘Android Studio’ to ‘Visual Studio’/‘MonoDevelop’. And these IDEs has different key bindings, which I really hate because I would somehow make mistakes by pressing the wrong key binding from previous IDE to current IDE. In this case, Emacs/Vim become useful because I could finally code all programming languages with the same key bindings. On the other hand, if you are a front-end developer you would recommend people use Sublime Text instead of Emacs because it is wasting your time and is not worth it anymore.\n* My emacs file config repo * url: https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs * Few Videos I watched when I learn Emacs * Casy’s Emacs Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbmV1bnQ-i0\u0026t=1584s Stop Worrying and Love Emacs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc ","wordCount":"495","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/cover.png","datePublished":"2017-11-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2017-11-12T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jen-Chieh Shen"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jen-Chieh's Website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/ accesskey=h title="Jen-Chieh's Website (Alt + H)">Jen-Chieh's Website</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/ title=Zh-Tw aria-label=Zh-Tw>Zh-Tw</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.artstation.com/jcs090218 title=Art><span>Art</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/storage/Resume.pdf title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Best Editor Ever</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2017-11-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 12, 2017</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>3 min</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>495 words</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>Jen-Chieh Shen</span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span>Translations:</span><ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/>Zh-Tw</a></li></ul></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager srcset='https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/cover_hu_f02d9ce9c76d7db8.png 360w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/cover_hu_c873902bd5c3e05d.png 480w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/cover_hu_bdcdc1b64dd8e97e.png 720w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/cover.png 1000w' src=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/cover.png sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" width=1000 height=667 alt></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#-my-emacs-file-config-repo- aria-label="* My emacs file config repo *">* My emacs file config repo *</a></li><li><a href=#-few-videos-i-watched-when-i-learn-emacs- aria-label="* Few Videos I watched when I learn Emacs *">* Few Videos I watched when I learn Emacs *</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>First the foremost, this article is all subjective opinions
