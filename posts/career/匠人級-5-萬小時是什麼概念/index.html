Average hours per day Ã— Number of days in a year Ã— Total number of years
I started programming in the spring of 2013 and decided to fully commit to it in 2014.
On average, I spend between 5 and 16 hours a day coding, non-stop, including weekends.
My time is easy to calculate because, aside from specific times when I go out,
I spend most of my time coding, except for eating, sleeping, and other necessities.
Iâ€™ve always had trouble sleeping, which means I donâ€™t sleep much during the day,
and often donâ€™t sleep at all. So I often end up coding for over 16 hours
(the longest stretch was probably over 36 hours). ðŸ¤”
