This is a rant about software engineering interviews and LeetCode.

🗯️ Preamble
In 2024, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are grinding through LeetCode, aiming to break into the tech industry, drawn by the high salaries it offers.
🤔 What does LeetCode actually bring?
LeetCode offers little more than these benefits:

Algorithm exercises and data structure knowledge
Coding under pressure (Why though? Are we in a war zone now?)
Passing coding interviews

However, completing LeetCode doesn&rsquo;t prove you&rsquo;re a good software engineer.
It only shows you can code basic algorithms and solve programming puzzles.
It doesn&rsquo;t test essential skills like collaboration, communication, documentation, design patterns, system architecture, low-level programming, or core computer science knowledge."><meta name=author content="Jen-Chieh Shen"><link rel=canonical href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/problem-with-leetcode-and-swe-jobs/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.5ada1624ffcc5fbf166a2f1b39c460549e60dc43eae054f24d7d595724eddedd.css integrity="sha256-WtoWJP/MX78Wai8bOcRgVJ5g3EPq4FTyTX1ZVyTt3t0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh-tw href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/posts/career/problem-with-leetcode-and-swe-jobs/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/problem-with-leetcode-and-swe-jobs/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-3MLWCB75D6"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-3MLWCB75D6")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/problem-with-leetcode-and-swe-jobs/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Jen-Chieh's Website"><meta property="og:title" content="Problem with LeetCode and SWE jobs"><meta property="og:description" content=" This is a rant about software engineering interviews and LeetCode.
