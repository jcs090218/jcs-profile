It brought back memories of my own experience as a so-called 10x engineer during my first job!\n🗯️ Preamble This took place during my very first job as a Unity software engineer at IMI Technology (which, by now, should have shut down). My primary responsibility was to develop board games.I joined the company mainly because it was conveniently close to home and the pay was reasonable, so I didn’t give it much thought. While some might find game development either intriguing or off-putting, this post isn’t about that industry. It’s purely a reflection of my own experience in software development.\n✏️ Overview The team was made up of 8 people: 5 senior engineers with over 10 years of experience, 1 junior developer, and 2 entry-level engineers. The roles were divided like this:\n3 senior engineers + 1 beginner developing servers in Java 1 senior engineer working with Phaser to develop web game clients 1 senior engineer + me (entry-level) developing the Unity game client 1 entry-level engineer learning the ropes (I’m not really sure what his specific role was) As you can see, I was tasked with working on the Unity game client alongside a senior engineer. Ironically, our team was on the brink of being disbanded. Apparently, our boss wasn’t happy with our progress, and the project was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the entire department was on the chopping block. 😒\n📊 Comparison Within our team, I handled all the core game development on my own, while another engineer focused on the UI. I completed the entire game in about a month (around 20 days), replicating all the content from the web client with ease. For comparison, it took the senior engineer 10 months to finish the web client.\nOf course, this is an unfair comparison. The web client engineer had to learn Phaser from scratch and develop the first version, which led to higher communication overhead. I just had to replicate what was already built. 🤔\nStill, when looking at the total development time alone (without diving into the nuances), it was a striking difference: 1 month vs. 10 months! 😬\n💬 Conclusion This happened back in July 2019 (nearly 5 years ago), so the details are a bit hazy, and this post is relatively short. Despite that, I wanted to document the experience because it’s unlikely I’ll go through something like this again—at least, I hope not! 💦\nI also want to stress that my former colleagues were extremely skilled, and I never questioned their professionalism. From what I saw, they were absolutely top-tier in their fields! 💯\n","wordCount":"505","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/cover.png","datePublished":"2024-09-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-09-06T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jen-Chieh Shen"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jen-Chieh's Website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/ accesskey=h title="Jen-Chieh's Website (Alt + H)">Jen-Chieh's Website</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/ title=Zh-Tw aria-label=Zh-Tw>Zh-Tw</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.artstation.com/jcs090218 title=Art><span>Art</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/storage/Resume.pdf title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Being 10x engineer in my first job</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-09-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 6, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>3 min</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>505 words</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>Jen-Chieh Shen</span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span>Translations:</span><ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/>Zh-Tw</a></li></ul></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager srcset='https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/cover_hu_59f3c4bd3cf546e5.png 360w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/cover_hu_b25b1fe31a5904a.png 480w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/cover_hu_74f83bc755dd457b.png 720w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/cover_hu_412431f0457e4f7c.png 1080w,https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/cover.png 1080w' src=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/cover.png sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" width=1080 height=540 alt></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#-preamble aria-label="🗯️ Preamble">🗯️ Preamble</a></li><li><a href=#-overview aria-label="✏️ Overview">✏️ Overview</a></li><li><a href=#-comparison aria-label="📊 Comparison">📊 Comparison</a></li><li><a href=#-conclusion aria-label="💬 Conclusion">💬 Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Recently, I came across a post on <a href=https://linkedin.com/>LinkedIn</a> with the eye-catching title, “I think I’ve met a 10x engineer.”
