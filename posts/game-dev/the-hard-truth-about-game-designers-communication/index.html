This issue has been simmering within the gaming industry for some time and has been troubling me as well. As a programmer, how can I communicate more smoothly with planners? This article simply aims to document the situations I have observed and, by the end, hopefully provide a better answer to my own doubts.\nüóØÔ∏è Introduction I am a professional game programmer with over 6 years of experience in the gaming industry, and over 10 years of actual game development experience (including my university days). As such, I consider myself to be a developer with considerable development experience. However, I have always had issues communicating with planners. Below, I would like to propose several broad directions that I believe are the root causes of this problem.\nüóëÔ∏è The barriers to entry for planning are too low, and there is a lack of professional domain knowledge. I think this title will upset many planners, but I believe it is a fact. Compared to art and programming, the barriers to entry for planning are much lower than for the other two categories. Some might say that planners also need to know and understand many things. I don‚Äôt deny that, but do you think professionals in other fields who are proficient in more skills know less than you? Are people who can‚Äôt even do programming or art really more passionate? Do they really only need to talk to get things done?\nNext, we can talk about communication skills. Most planners only know how to express things related to their own experience. This statement may be a bit unclear, so let‚Äôs use an example. For example, when designing a game system that interacts with another system in a special way, most planners can only describe what they see and cannot analyze the underlying logic or operational mechanisms of the system (the process of reverse engineering). But the question is, who wouldn‚Äôt do that? Can a skill that even casual players can possess truly be called professional expertise? ü§î At best, they‚Äôre just players working in the game industry, often jokingly referred to as ‚Äúidea generators.‚Äù\nDoes that mean planners have no professional knowledge at all? Not exactly. I believe planning is the field that requires the most knowledge. The problem lies with the industry itself, and the specific reasons need to be examined from a historical perspective.\nüìú Looking at it from a historical perspective This is just speculation, but there is no evidence to support it. In fact, such information has been revealed in many past interviews.\nHow did the planning work come about? In the past, planning responsibilities were shared between programmers and artists (mostly programmers), resulting in fewer communication issues, primarily because their knowledge levels were relatively similar. Over time, the workload became too heavy for programmers and artists to handle alone, leading to the emergence of the planning role. Many believed that planning could be delegated to others, essentially treating it as a menial task.\nThe idea of having the planner handle this work is not inherently problematic, but the biggest issue arises when some people suggest that the planner should lead the project. This is a significant concern, as it would be akin to having a general assistant serve as your leader‚Äîcan you truly trust such an arrangement?\n‚ùì So why is communication with artists not a problem? I think the reason is simple. Artists are a profession that is close to players, so it makes sense. Let‚Äôs take a more practical example. Artists can draw a flying horse, but can you ‚Äúmake‚Äù a flying horse in reality? Obviously not. At its core, drawing and engineering are fundamentally different disciplines.\nüí° Becoming a true planner I don‚Äôt consider myself a planner, but I believe a competent planner possesses the following qualities (at least the abilities that past planners have had).\nThe ability to reverse engineer and uncover the underlying mechanics of a game. Possessing basic programming and art skills‚Äînot top-notch, but not so lacking that communication is impossible! Being able to make accurate and realistic proposals (to assist art and programming). The main distinction here is whether you are a ‚Äúplanner‚Äù or just a ‚Äúplayer who happens to be working in the game industry‚Äù? ü§î\nüí¨ Conclusion I have led countless development teams, and every project has this issue. So if you‚Äôre working on a project like this, don‚Äôt feel too discouraged or angry, because you‚Äôre not alone. But the issue still exists and will continue to exist for some time. I believe that understanding the current situation is the only way to truly improve collaboration between development teams.\nI‚Äôd like to add that no solution is provided here, because I believe the problem lies in the industry standards having deviated from their original purpose. In a way, it‚Äôs unsolvable. ü§î\n","wordCount":"820","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/cover.webp","datePublished":"2025-06-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-16T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jen-Chieh Shen"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/game-dev/the-hard-truth-about-game-designers-communication/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jen-Chieh's Website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/ accesskey=h title="Jen-Chieh's Website (Alt + H)">Jen-Chieh's Website</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/ title=Zh-Tw aria-label=Zh-Tw>Zh-Tw</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.artstation.com/jcs090218 title=Art><span>Art</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/storage/Resume.pdf title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Problem with Game Designers communicate with programmers</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-06-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 16, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;820 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Jen-Chieh Shen&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://www.jcs-profile.com/zh-tw/posts/game-dev/the-hard-truth-about-game-designers-communication/>Zh-Tw</a></li></ul></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/game-dev/the-hard-truth-about-game-designers-communication/cover.webp alt></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#-introduction aria-label="üóØÔ∏è Introduction">üóØÔ∏è Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#-the-barriers-to-entry-for-planning-are-too-low-and-there-is-a-lack-of-professional-domain-knowledge aria-label="üóëÔ∏è The barriers to entry for planning are too low, and there is a lack of professional domain knowledge.">üóëÔ∏è The barriers to entry for planning are too low, and there is a lack of professional domain knowledge.</a></li><li><a href=#-looking-at-it-from-a-historical-perspective aria-label="üìú Looking at it from a historical perspective">üìú Looking at it from a historical perspective</a></li><li><a href=#-so-why-is-communication-with-artists-not-a-problem aria-label="‚ùì So why is communication with artists not a problem?">‚ùì So why is communication with artists not a problem?</a></li><li><a href=#-becoming-a-true-planner aria-label="üí° Becoming a true planner">üí° Becoming a true planner</a></li><li><a href=#-conclusion aria-label="üí¨ Conclusion">üí¨ Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I‚Äôve been wanting to write an article about communication
