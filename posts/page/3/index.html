Many of my works are about making API. I always have their trouble making API documents for myself and for people to read what each API does. To resolve this issue, I spent a few hours to design a small website that I could drop the HTML file in the target folder and it will show the file on the website. The following list is the list of technologies I used in the project.

This is the final project from the first class of web development from our school. I joined this class as an elective class so I could have a peek of how web development works. A list below is few highlights I would like to show from this project.
Parallax Effect Use of Sound Gashapon 👁️ Parallax Effect Most parallax effect I have seen aren’t quite satisfied to me. Generally they will have a image at the back of other components then have it semi-stationary to sit still at the place. In this project I would like to have a peek of how CSS can do on 2016. Fortunately, after being learning animation system from CSS I am for sure that the parallax effect I was to imagine are possible to accomplish by just the CSS without using JavaScript. You can use the small panel on the top left corner to navigate through the four pages from this website.

Acknowledge I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine. In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying “Data Structure”, “Algorithms”, “Design Patterns”. What I presume that Design Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc.

I hold onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs.

I believed text editor is just tool to help programmer make a software and get their job done.
At my previous post ' Framework I have been working… (Part 2) ’ I mentioned I watched a few episodes of ' Handmade Hero ’s series. Casey Muratori was using Emacs as a text editor coding C/C++(I think now he use 4coder instead of Emacs). I was surprised by how fast he can code in Emacs. So I made some research and discovered there is Vim which is another great text editor competing with Emacs. I decide to give both editor a try, and it turn out I chose Emacs over Vim.

Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game industry. Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity.
