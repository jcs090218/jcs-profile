      <description>&lt;p&gt;Productivity is topic that often is ignored by a lot programmer. I have
seen a bunch of documents out there talking about algorithm and data structure,
so I would like to post a topic about productivity for an advanced programmer
or for the programmer who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly
mean productivity in software development field? If you have seen my previous
blog post &#39;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jcs-profile.com/?page=Framework_sp_I_sp_have_sp_been_sp_working_sp_-Part_sp_1-&#34;&gt;Framework I have been working&amp;hellip; (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;rsquo; and &#39;

&amp;lsquo;, then you might already know what I am going to write about for the rest of
this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of
our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts
work on the same project, and of course for game development students we
decide to make a AR game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always
not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game
industry. Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and
the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and
every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I
think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first
day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
