      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of talking about myself. Primarily I&amp;rsquo;m nobody, not phenomenal, and never been onto news or other media, not any of those. Is hard to think that who will spend their precious time reading this &amp;lsquo;About Me&amp;rsquo; article. I would desire not to write a verbose introduction about myself. I&amp;rsquo;m currently 24; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that I lived long, but long enough for me to review my past few years of living and consider what&amp;rsquo;s the future path I&amp;rsquo;m going to step in.</description>

      <description>I have heard about people saying that writing a blog is a good idea. And here is it, I am going to write a development blog for myself. I have been coding for years and would like to share what I had been through and talk about more like what I think is significants to a programmer. What are the jobs and tasks to the programmer and what does programmer does?</description>
