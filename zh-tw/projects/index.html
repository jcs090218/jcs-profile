✨🔗🏅): 分叉自 ad-m/github-push-action，此分叉包含為我的自動化工作流程量身打造的 rebase 選項。 setup-emacs (夏 2022 🏅): 安裝指定 Emacs 版本的 Github Actions。本專案的目的是取代 purcell/setup-emacs， 將 purcell/setup-emacs 和 setup-emacs-windows 兩個 GitHub Actions 合而為一。因此，它現在支援所有常用的作業系統。 setup-eask (春 2022 🏅): 為 Github Actions 工作流程安裝 Eask。 unity-verify-code (秋 2021 🏅): 電子郵件解析器可取得 6 位數驗證碼，以繞過 TFA。 unity-license-activate (秋 2021 🏅): 透過 CLI 啟動 Unity 的個人授權。 setup-emacs-windows (秋 2020 🏅): 可安裝特定 Emacs 版本的 Github Actions。 本專案的靈感來自 purcell/setup-emacs ，但特別致力於支援傳統的 Windows 系統。 package-bot (春 2020 – 秋 2020): 自動檢閱 MELPA 上的新套件 PR。 由社群要求，請參考 melpa#6714。 雖然最終沒有被接受，但它推動社群走向更好的替代方案 - melpazoid。 ⏸️ 暫停中的專案（或許有一天會完成） 詳細資訊 flx-hs (春 2025): 在 Haskell 中重寫 emacs-flx。 aws-toolkit-emacs (冬 2023): 從 Emacs 編輯器與 AWS 互動的外掛程式。 jcs-lem (夏 2023 – 現在): 我個人的 lem 設定檔案。 Lem is still in its early stages, particularly on Windows systems. Prevo (夏 2021): 使用預覽視窗預覽 GameObject。 8comic (秋 2020): 使用 8comic 來閱讀漫畫。 UCTooth (夏 2020 💸): 適用於 Unity 的跨平台藍牙外掛，以各平台的原生程式碼實作。 swagger-it (春 2020): 自動為專案產生 swagger.io yaml 檔案。 CCosQuick (冬 2019 – 夏 2020 💸): 使用建立在 Cocos Creator 之上的元件驅動程式庫，輕鬆製作遊戲原型。 MGDP (秋 2019 – 冬 2019): Quaver 基本上是 DJMax 的複製品；因此，我不確定是否要繼續這個專案。 Client (封閉源碼): 本遊戲用戶端使用 Unity 引擎，旨在實現 MGDP 專案的遊戲性。 DevTool (封閉源碼): 一個簡單的桌面應用程式可以協助我產生音樂存檔，然後將其部署到伺服器上。 DevelopmentKit (封閉源碼): 讓 MGDP 遊戲開發人員有能力創作自己的音樂遊戲，並在 MGDP 平台上發行。 JCSUE (秋 2017): 利用多種元件和預先定義的預設設定，快速建構您的遊戲。 jcs-vim (冬 2016): 我個人的 vim 配置文件。 這是我使用 Vim 的初步經驗，我有興趣在未來探索 NeoVim。 🛑 廢棄專案（永遠無法完成） 詳細資訊 tree-sitter-actionscript (春 2021): ActionScript 文法的 tree-sitter。 Rileran 較早前已完成該專案 - Rileran/tree-sitter-actionscript，因此，不需要再繼續進行該專案。 聲明一下，Rileran 的專案靈感來自我的專案！ work-time (春 2021): 您工作多久了？ 我不確定它目前的值，因為它有可能被 wakatime 和 hammy.el 取代。 organize-imports-python (春 2021): 自動組織 Python 程式碼中的匯入。 由於 語言伺服器協定 的出現，已經沒有理由再建立這個套件了。 vlc-player (冬 2019): 使用 VLC 播放視訊。 我記不起放棄這個功能的確切原因。我的最佳推測是 VLC 不支援停止視訊的必要選項，促使我改用 ffmpeg。 JCSEgret (冬 2018 💸): 以 Egret 引擎為基礎，專為高效率遊戲製作而設計的程式庫。該專案是在工作期間啟動的，但由於 Egret 引擎在其破產後變得過時，因此已不再使用。
