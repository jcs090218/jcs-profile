[{"content":" This is a rant about software engineering interviews and LeetCode.\n🗯️ Preamble In 2024, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are grinding through LeetCode, aiming to break into the tech industry, drawn by the high salaries it offers.\n🤔 What does LeetCode actually bring? LeetCode offers little more than these benefits:\nAlgorithm exercises and data structure knowledge Coding under pressure (Why though? Are we in a war zone now?) Passing coding interviews However, completing LeetCode doesn\u0026rsquo;t prove you\u0026rsquo;re a good software engineer. It only shows you can code basic algorithms and solve programming puzzles. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t test essential skills like collaboration, communication, documentation, design patterns, system architecture, low-level programming, or core computer science knowledge.\nIf LeetCode only tests these basic skills, what are employers hiring for? An entry-level programmer? It\u0026rsquo;s like hiring a doctor but only testing their basic chemistry knowledge—something they rarely use in real-world situations.\n⁉️ What\u0026rsquo;s the real issue? LeetCode practice isn\u0026rsquo;t about learning. You don’t gain insights into computer science or system design;instead, you learn how to pass coding interviews. If the problem isn’t obvious, here’s another way to look at it: it’s like being in school where learning isn\u0026rsquo;t the point—passing the test and getting good grades is. This mentality might explain why some people, despite being labeled as \u0026ldquo;educated,\u0026rdquo; still act or think poorly. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re doing the same thing with tech interviews.\nLeetCode is not Software Engineering. 😕\n💡 What are better solutions? There are so many more productive things to do. Contribute to Nix/NixOS, improve Emacs’ ecosystem, enhance Java package management, work on C and CMake workflows, better the Godot Asset Store, or practice writing parsers and language servers. So much remains imperfect, yet people waste time on LeetCode. 😢\nIt’s better to study other people\u0026rsquo;s code, talk to them, and learn how they solve real-world programming problems.\nThe industry is suffering because we’ve taken the lazy route—using software to filter candidates without assessing real talent. 😞\n😤 I\u0026rsquo;m not alone A quick Google search reveals countless rants:\nLeetCode Ruined Software Engineering… LeetCode: The Worst Thing to Happen to Software Engineering 💬 Conclusion We can\u0026rsquo;t escape this trend.

The author described how one of their colleagues had managed to fix a bunch of complex bugs in a short amount of time, which left them in awe. 🤔\nBut is that really what defines a 10x engineer? It brought back memories of my own experience as a so-called 10x engineer during my first job!\n🗯️ Preamble This took place during my very first job as a Unity software engineer at IMI Technology (which, by now, should have shut down). My primary responsibility was to develop board games.I joined the company mainly because it was conveniently close to home and the pay was reasonable, so I didn’t give it much thought. While some might find game development either intriguing or off-putting, this post isn’t about that industry. It’s purely a reflection of my own experience in software development.\n✏️ Overview The team was made up of 8 people: 5 senior engineers with over 10 years of experience, 1 junior developer, and 2 entry-level engineers. The roles were divided like this:\n3 senior engineers + 1 beginner developing servers in Java 1 senior engineer working with Phaser to develop web game clients 1 senior engineer + me (entry-level) developing the Unity game client 1 entry-level engineer learning the ropes (I’m not really sure what his specific role was) As you can see, I was tasked with working on the Unity game client alongside a senior engineer. Ironically, our team was on the brink of being disbanded. Apparently, our boss wasn’t happy with our progress, and the project was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the entire department was on the chopping block. 😒\n📊 Comparison Within our team, I handled all the core game development on my own, while another engineer focused on the UI. I completed the entire game in about a month (around 20 days), replicating all the content from the web client with ease. For comparison, it took the senior engineer 10 months to finish the web client.\nOf course, this is an unfair comparison. The web client engineer had to learn Phaser from scratch and develop the first version, which led to higher communication overhead. I just had to replicate what was already built. 🤔\nStill, when looking at the total development time alone (without diving into the nuances), it was a striking difference: 1 month vs. 10 months! 😬\n💬 Conclusion This happened back in July 2019 (nearly 5 years ago), so the details are a bit hazy, and this post is relatively short. Despite that, I wanted to document the experience because it’s unlikely I’ll go through something like this again—at least, I hope not! 💦\nI also want to stress that my former colleagues were extremely skilled, and I never questioned their professionalism. From what I saw, they were absolutely top-tier in their fields! 💯\n","permalink":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, I came across a post on \u003ca href=\"https://linkedin.com/\"\u003eLinkedIn\u003c/a\u003e with the eye-catching title, “I think I’ve met a 10x engineer.”\nBut as I read through the post, I started to have doubts.

It’s interesting since people don’t think a language server for Emacs Lisp will provide any value. The statement is correct, and so do I. Emacs Lisp is only used within the Emacs editor, and Emacs itself is an Emacs Lisp interpreter. Therefore, a language server for Emacs Lisp would hardly bring any benefits to Emacs users.\nBut imagine you can code elisp (short for Emacs Lisp) outside of Emacs. That sounds interesting, huh? 🤔\n🔰 Start from scratch Okay, I didn\u0026rsquo;t start entirely from scratch. I did use some libraries to help me set up things faster. Here are the important one:\nlsp-mode elsa - I\u0026rsquo;ve used some of their code What I\u0026rsquo;ve started from scratch is the stdio solution. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how simple stdio can be within Emacs\u0026rsquo; batch mode.\n💫 Issue 1: read-from-minibuffer and \\r/\\n The function read-from-minibuffer is one way to receive standard input within Emacs\u0026rsquo; batch mode. There is one issue with this method. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive input until there is a \\r or \\n character at the end. That\u0026rsquo;s annoying since the language server would never receive the complete packet. Here is what I would receive from the language client:\nContent-Length: 8203\\r\\n \\r\\n {json} And, this is what I hope to see:\nContent-Length: 8203\\r\\n \\r\\n {json}\\r\\n I’ve spent a couple of hours searching for a solution. Unfortunately, I’m not able to find one. Then, I decided to create a proxy stdio application using node.js and JavaScript that forwards an extra \\r\\n at the end of the packet.\nlet proc = startEmacs(); // Create process Emacs process.stdin.on(\u0026#39;data\u0026#39;, function(data) { let input = data.toString(); proc.stdin.write(input + \u0026#39;\\r\\n\u0026#39;); // Forward with an extra `\\r\\n`! }); Wola, now I am able to receive data from the language client! 🚀\nmethod: initialize \u0026lt;\u0026lt; {\u0026#34;jsonrpc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:0,\u0026#34;result\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;server-info\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ellsp\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;version\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.1.0\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;hoverProvider\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;textDocumentSync\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;openClose\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;save\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;change\u0026#34;:1},\u0026#34;completionProvider\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;resolveProvider\u0026#34;:false},\u0026#34;signatureHelpProvider\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;triggerCharacters\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34; \u0026#34;]}}}} 💫 Issue 2: Specification\u0026hellip; error?

Here is a list of famous ELPA; see their site for more information!\nGNU Elpa (official) NonGNU Elpa (official) MELPA ❓ Why? So why do we want to host our own ELPA? Aren’t those ELPAs enough?\nYes, in general, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to host ELPA yourself since most packages you need will be available in one of those ELPA (packages can co-exist between ELPA). Here are several reasons why you might want to build your own ELPA:\nThe package you like isn’t (yet) on any ELPA ELPA\u0026rsquo;s package review takes a couple of days or months to review (MELPA is probably the fastest) For packages that are no longer maintained, you can link to the newly maintained fork Similar to Pt. 3, if there are bugs in the package you like, you can create a new fork to replace it! For elisp package development purposes. Sometimes, more than the build tools are needed. 📝 Prerequisite Some knowledge about Emacs Lisp Install Eask CLI 🔍 Step 1. Create ELPA project It\u0026rsquo;s easy to build your own ELPA with Eask. You only need a few commands, and it will run.\nFirst, we need to create the ELPA project:\n$ eask create elpa \u0026lt;project_name\u0026gt; In the example, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use my-elpa as my project name:\n$ eask create elpa my-elpa Then you will be prompted to create the Eask file; enter the required information like this:\n✓ Done cloning the ELPA template Initialize the Eask-file for your project... package name: (my-elpa) version: (1.0.0) description: Test ELPA entry point: (my-elpa.el) emacs version: (26.1) website: keywords: elpa About to write to /home/jenchieh/my-elpa/Eask: (package \u0026#34;my-elpa\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Test ELPA\u0026#34;) (website-url \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) (keywords \u0026#34;elpa\u0026#34;) (package-file \u0026#34;my-elpa.el\u0026#34;) (script \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; \u0026#34;echo \\\u0026#34;Error: no test specified\\\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exit 1\u0026#34;) (source \u0026#34;gnu\u0026#34;) (depends-on \u0026#34;emacs\u0026#34; \u0026#34;26.1\u0026#34;) Is this OK?

I have created my first language server that is actually useful to someone. I tried a language server a while back, but it was just an example server, so it’s not very useful, and it’s only for educational purposes.\nThe target language I chose to write is the ShaderLab language. ShaderLab is used in Unity Engine, so you can write custom shaders to stylize your game. Unlike regular programming languages, ShaderLab is much simpler to analyze, so the language server can respond to the client side.\n❓ Why chose C# as the implementaion language? Since Unity Engine\u0026rsquo;s most popular scripting language is C#, I reckon choosing C# is the perfect match.\n💀 C# Language Server Protocal Hell I already had a bad feeling when writing a language server in C# before starting it since I never had a good impression of the author Omnisharp\u0026rsquo;s plugins. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried their official C# plugins on the VSCode Marketplace, but to be honest, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say I like it. Here are a few reasons why:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s slow Constant breaking changes. Next update nothing works! Maintainers are not very active (but the community is friendly though) Nevertheless, I insist on giving csharp-language-server-protocol a shot since there are no other reasonable alternatives. After digging it for a few days, here are issues I am facing:\nExample from the official repository is either broken or incomplete (kinda useless) Obsolete or lack of documentation They don\u0026rsquo;t really care about other editors. (Many editor compatible issues and PRs are left opened) Fortunately, I found the thousand language server created by @gulbanana and HlslTools created by @tgjones. Therefore, I am able to accomplish this project by seeing their implementations! 😅😇\nP.S. It took me very long to figure things out!!! 💀\n⚙️ Plug-in ShaderlabVS Another challenge is the engine of the language server. What parses the text document and gives reasonable responses to the client? Then I found a project that already does that for me \u0026ndash; ShaderlabVS. It\u0026rsquo;s an ideal solution since the implementation are also in C#. Thanks to the author @wudixiaop for this amazing project! ❤️\n💥 Create a language server client Okay, now we have a language server up and running, but there is no way to test it! I\u0026rsquo;m an Emacs user, so I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to create an Emacs package \u0026ndash; lsp-shader that uses lsp-mode as the base and use it as my language server\u0026rsquo;s client. I\u0026rsquo;ve already created several language server\u0026rsquo;s clients in Emacs Lisp, so creating another isn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult. 😁\n📦 Publish on NuGet I have no experience publishing packages to NuGet, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard after watching a couple of tutorials on YouTube. I use the csharp-language-server created by @razzmatazz as my reference since this is the only project I know with a similar structure I want.\nIn closing, you only need two step to publish package on NuGet. 😋\nPack the package from Visual Studio Upload to NuGet site 🎖️ Achievement Created a language server.

I have developed more than 150 elisp packages, and maintained over 200 packages (including my packages). It\u0026rsquo;s been a long journey staying in the Emacs community, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good for me to slow myself down and step back a little and think what I\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished through out these years.\n💫 How I got into Emacs? Many people asked me this question, so I decided to reply it here.\nI first saw Emacs is at 2015, seeing Casey Muratori\u0026rsquo;s Handmade Hero series. I was blown away by how fast he can code in Emacs. How he can jump to other window and never leave the keyboard are all new to me.\nBut if I look at his configuration now, it\u0026rsquo;s actually not so great. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any third-party packages, so he has every defined in his own configuration file (~/.emacs file). The configuration can still be great without using those third-party packages, but it will only limit you and remake the wheel that maybe others have already done for you.\nBesides all of that, Casey is still a top-tier programmer I have known in my whole life. ❤️\n💫 How much I\u0026rsquo;ve put my time to Emacs? Like I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above, trust me. I put in a lot of time to accomplish what I\u0026rsquo;ve done for the Emacs community. If you search all my packages, I hold the most packages in MELPA. The time I have put kinda proof how much I love Emacs, but also how much I get disappointed with Emacs. 😥\n💫 Why Emacs isn\u0026rsquo;t the worth my time anymore? First of all, there is nothing wrong with the Emacs\u0026rsquo; devel. They did a great job keeping Emacs alive, and I like their mentality and most of their technical decisions.\nFor me, the problem is the Elisp dev ecosystem (not the Emacs community itself; consider the Elisp dev ecosystem is the subset of the Emacs community). I appreciate people willing to contribute to Emacs, but I hate when they don\u0026rsquo;t consider their packages' cross-platform capability. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m a Windows user; actually, I use all the most used systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows). I hate that when I try a package, it only works on a specific system (excluding packages that only rely on certain systems), but it is supposed to work on all systems. I feel terrible and frustrated because most of the Elisp dev does not care or does not care enough about the minority users (Windows users). Even some famous packages don\u0026rsquo;t work well on Windows, magit is slow, straight.el is slow, helm is slow, ivy is slow, projectile is broken, eping is broken, EAF is constatly broken, etc. I use over 500 packages in my configuration. I can list a ton of packages that have terrible cross-platform capability.\nBut are they all bad? Of course not. Most of the authors show patience and are willing to help you with the issue you have encountered. At least they have tried to solve these issues and provide a workaround, etc. Like magit has a GitHub issue (magit/#2982) that explicitly talking about the Windows performance. EAF authors and maintainers constantly respond to the users they have trouble with. These projects are amazing, and I appreciate them so much! But most of them aren\u0026rsquo;t like that\u0026hellip; Unfortunately, they either don\u0026rsquo;t care or don\u0026rsquo;t care enough.\nIn the 2020 Emacs survey, Windows users are only 8%! I\u0026rsquo;ve heard a lot of people claim I\u0026rsquo;m wrong. First of all, I\u0026rsquo;m in the minority; only God knows what we think. Second of all, I wish more than anyone I am wrong. I don\u0026rsquo;t care if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong or not. I want the UX to be improved!\nMany people complain about the OS (Windows), suggest using the WSL, etc. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the issue. Ignoring the issue is the issue! If you can\u0026rsquo;t solve the issue from another platform, don\u0026rsquo;t blame the platform. Blame yourself! There are no bad systems, only bad programmers (in this case).\nTo answer my own question, I am tired of being in the minority. It\u0026rsquo;s laborious and tedious. I\u0026rsquo;m tired of complaining to other Elisp dev. For people that know me, you know I hate to say all this. It\u0026rsquo;s sad and hopeless. Why bother? You might have known why I put so much time into Emacs. I\u0026rsquo;m only filling the gap between Unix-like systems and Windows. And yes, all my packages work across all platforms.\n💫 Will I leave Emacs community? The short answer is no. I will most likely not going to develop more Emacs packages anymore; unless I really want to. But I will continue to maintain all the packages I\u0026rsquo;m currently maintaining since I will continue to use Emacs for my future work!\n⚜️ Conclusion I didn\u0026rsquo;t know the article would be this long. It\u0026rsquo;s been a very long journey for me. I have learned a lot from this community and know many great people. I appreciate people who use my packages and those who do care the minority users like me. ❤️🙏\n","permalink":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/long-journey-with-emacs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e⚠️ The intention of this post is to remind myself why Emacs isn\u0026rsquo;t worth my time anymore.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Emacs since 2015.

Therefore, in this article, I\u0026rsquo;m going to teach people how to use this tool to help you build your own elisp packages! 😄\n🗨️ Trouble using Eask Eask now has more than 50 commands (including hidden ones). The tool is fairly complex so the first thing you need to know is to use --help when have trouble using this tool.\n$ eask --help 📦 Build the package Here we jump right into the package development. I assumed you already know how to create Eask-file and want to use this tool effectively right a way.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to use an existing elisp package I\u0026rsquo;ve created openai.el just to show the workflow.\n# Clone the project $ git clone https://github.com/emacs-openai/openai.git # Navigate to project directory cd sideline # (Optional) Print the folder structure tree /f The project structure looks like this:\n│ .dir-locals.el │ .gitignore │ CHANGELOG.md │ Eask │ LICENSE.txt │ Makefile │ openai-audio.el │ openai-chat.el │ openai-completion.el │ openai-edit.el │ openai-embedding.el │ openai-engine.el │ openai-file.el │ openai-fine-tune.el │ openai-image.el │ openai-model.el │ openai-moderation.el │ openai.el │ README.md │ └───.github └───workflows test.yml We first build the package with:\n$ eask package This command will create a folder dist, and here is the result:\nNoticed this is a multi-file package so it\u0026rsquo;s built into a tar file. If we inspect the tar file, then this is the result:\n⚙ Install it Now you have created the package successfully, it means your package will have no issue hosting on any ELPA (GNU Elpa, MELPA, etc.). People can download your package on the ELPA you like to host. The next step is to test installing the package. It\u0026rsquo;s meaningless if people can download your package but aren\u0026rsquo;t able to install it. We install the package with the install command:\n$ eask install The package is installed in an isolated environment, so it won\u0026rsquo;t create any side effects to your personal configuration ~/.emacs.d/. Here is the result:\n📋 Activate in runtime The activation test is simple, we normally want to check if your package will run correctly on your user\u0026rsquo;s machine.\n$ eask test activate You should see the following output:\nLoading package information... done v Activating the package `openai\u0026#39;... succeeded v (Nothing to load.) Great! It means our package has been activated without any error! 😋\nThis step is generally optional, but it\u0026rsquo;s good to know if you will encounter any runtime errors!\n👷 Compile it! It\u0026rsquo;s time to compile your package! Compile step is the same as the install step. The only difference is it won\u0026rsquo;t need to be built (eask package) to test to see if your package will install correctly. Therefore, compile step is very helpful since we don\u0026rsquo;t always want to build the package for every change we have made.\n$ eask compile And yes, it compiles successfully without any errors! 😋\nCompiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-audio.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-chat.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-completion.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-edit.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-embedding.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-engine.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-file.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-fine-tune.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-image.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-model.el... done v Compiling d:/_workspace/elisp/openai/openai-moderation.el... done v (Total of 12 files compiled, 0 skipped) ⚜️ Conclusion These are the basic uses of Eask, but there are more things that Eask can do.

Let\u0026rsquo;s define it first! The ELPA runs the fastest? No, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense. The ELPA serves you the fastest? Maybe.\nThe definition for fastest ELPA in this article means it builds your packages the fastest! You might wonder why and how! Let me explain it to you!\nNormal ELPA, like MELPA, builds packages from the recipes directory, so it takes O(n) to do so. The more packages one ELPA holds, take longer the time to get packages to update to the server. The general solution is to use a more powerful PC to reduce the build time.\nHere comes JCS-ELPA, it uses the package github-elpa to host packages on the GitHub pages! But why is it the fastest LEPA? There are two factors:\nMicrosoft owns GitHub so technically we serve our ELPA on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s server We build packages using GitHub Actions with multiple jobs (if you are unfamiliar with GHA, think as multiple PCs helping you build your packages) JCS-ELPA builds your packages with multiple jobs simultaneously! The formula:\nNew build time = Original Build time / jobs If jobs is equal to 1, then the new build time equals to original build time (no build time improvement). For example, if original build time is 10 minutes, and we start 3 jobs, the new build time will be 2 minutes.\n2 min = 10 min / 5 jobs Of course, this is not going to happen in the real life. In reality, we will need to consume time on job scheduling, starting and closing time for the jobs, etc. But in theory, the more packages the ELPA holds, you will see the big differences between these two models.\n👷 How does it work? 💡 Here we only explain how it works sine there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough packages to proof this ELPA is the fastest!\nAs of right now, there are only 136 packages hosted on JCS-ELPA. I have split these recipes into smaller sections. Let\u0026rsquo;s say 50 per section! The formula will be:\njobs = (total recipes / recipes per section) + 1 Hence:\n3 = (136 / 50) + 1 Now you have 3 workers to help you build packages onto our server! The original build time was 4 to 5 minutes, now it\u0026rsquo;s 1.5 minutes!

But I have come to the point that I reckon the price and services aren\u0026rsquo;t something that I need. Therefore, I have decided to switch to another web hosting company just for another taste.\nThe main reasons are listed below:\nAWS charges you money when you click on their services without notifying the user.

If we checked who.is; the registrar is amazon.com. I bought the domain name using AWS\u0026rsquo;s Route 53. But now, I would like to transfer it to Namecheap . This isn\u0026rsquo;t the cheapest choice, but I like their UI/UX. It\u0026rsquo;s simpler and looks much more organized compared to AWS\u0026rsquo;s UI.\nI watched the below video when I was picking my new domain name registrar. I attempted to use Google Domains since it\u0026rsquo;s the best choice from the video, but it came out it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support my country/region, Taiwan (WIP). So I go for the second best choice, which is Namecheap. 😅\nCraylor Made explains very well! Big thanks to him!\nNOTE: It took them 5 days to complete transfer. So I\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait until the transfer is completed!\n📂 Transfer data Transfer data is easy, I use FileZilla (as always) to download all the files I need to move over to the new server. Unlike Node, PHP, or MySQL; there isn\u0026rsquo;t much environment I need to set up (except the Nginx) . We would just have to ensure don\u0026rsquo;t ever close the old server until we have moved everything to the new server!\nSomething I always want to try out is the Docker migration.

Meet the team I was in the MatchWorkshop community once a while ago, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time and a chance to get to know each other well. This is the right time for me to network with other people who already have working experience in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Game Industry.

Without their contribution, our game will simply be a disaster. Yi is responsible for making our characters (Minions and Alice) look alive, which requires countless hours to accomplish such a heavy task. Kyrie made a decent GDD, and shows his passion during the entire Game Jam.\nWhat about Jen-Chieh (me)? He made the entire game (programming-wise) within 24 hours. It could be impressive but expected. 🙂 All I want to say is THANK YOU to the group!\n💡 Design, and Programmer View First of all, I didn\u0026rsquo;t come up with the game idea. The game design had been established before I joined the team. Therefore, I will only talk about the game-making (engineering) part of the game. Here are some issues that I think are worth mentioning for the record:\nGDD is incomplete, lack of details We don\u0026rsquo;t know who came up with the idea? (even at the very end of the event) No core design principles, game idea could not be established Nice reminder, this is NOT for me to blame on anyone in the group. I am simply pointing it out to help myself do better in the future. Anyways, we eventually made the game! Congratulation! 🎉🎊 Seeing the finished game always makes me feel good! ✨\n🖼️ Screenshots 💬 Conclusion Let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the conclusion; I sense this project is great compared to many games that have been submitted to the same event. Even though the game isn\u0026rsquo;t a complete complete game, but it has everything a game needs, and there are more details in the game. I am proud of myself in this event! 👍 The only thing I have in mind so the game can be more inclusive is that we don\u0026rsquo;t have time to debug and playtest more.

It\u0026rsquo;s like npm to Node.js; but it isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the same since Eask has fewer tools than npm, plus their ecosystems are slightly different. Below is the link Why Cask? has a better explanation.\nWhy Cask? ❓ Then why Eask, and not Cask? A simple comparison table below:\nBehind technology Cross-Platform Emacs Version Size Cask Bash, Batch, and Python (Windows) ❌ Good on Linux and macOS, but it\u0026rsquo;s particularly bad on Windows 24.5+ 3,000+ lines makem.sh Shellscript ❌ Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on Windows by default 26.1+ 1 file, 1200+ lines Eldev Bash, Batch, and Powershel, etc ✔ Good, but qutie slow on Windows 24.4+ 4,000+ lines Eask Node or Native Executables ✔ Good, and it can be compiled to native executables 26.1+ 3,000+ lines (Table is copy and paste, please visit the site here)\nEask\u0026rsquo;s advantages came from the behind technology choice; it uses Node.js and not Shellscript, Bash, Batch, etc. It would require us to use Node runtime, but we can use pkg (big thanks to vercel) for packaging into native executable to avoid such a hassle.\nI hope the needs to install Node.js and the extra step to call npm install are the only defect from Eask. So what are the GOODS stuff?\nEask can be packaged into native executables; it should give you a better speed! It uses Cask\u0026rsquo;s DSL; it became very easy to adapt from Cask to Eask Eask-file is unlike Cask-file; it\u0026rsquo;s an Elisp file and functions similar to init.el (combined from Cask + Eldev) Use high-level programming language JavaScript; npm has a huge ecosystem. We can always fall back to the node layer if something doesn\u0026rsquo;t work inside Emacs (e.g. exec, init) Eask uses yargs as their CLI parsing library, which makes us only have to focus on the development Eask doesn\u0026rsquo;t require to call Emacs all the time; this is particularly good in Windows due to the fork operation is quite slow in the system (this is why I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend Eldev under Windows) Cross-platform and consistency; other alternatives don\u0026rsquo;t support Windows by default except for Eldev It\u0026rsquo;s easy to expand, and clearer project architecture; Cask, Eldev, and makem.sh have their files very huge, so it would be harder to maintain or add new features Global flag -g allows you to manage your Emacs configuration Eask sounds good, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect. Here are the BADS:\nHarder to get into the development; you will need to know JavaScript and npm Eask project structure follows 1 command to 1 file; people hate having multiple files everywhere The project is much more complicated (same as no. 2) 🧙‍♂️ Conclusion After seeing and comparing all the alternatives; I would eventually pick Eask as my major management tool. Eask has more potential if we compare it to the others; on the other hand, I think JavaScript and npm are very easy to learn.\nI have been using Emacs on Windows for 7 years; it\u0026rsquo;s quite painful. In general, many packages are either broken or doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a good user experience. I sometimes do have a good user experience but rarely. For example, magit, helm, is slow on Windows. Simple ping package eping doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Windows\u0026rsquo; ping.exe. Last time installing docker.el doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on Windows (1 week ago). I know the fact is Emacs is just too slow on Windows, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do anything about it! The fact is user experience is still bad on Windows, though! 😅\nMany people seem to use Cask, but the majority of them don\u0026rsquo;t require tests on Windows. It\u0026rsquo;s simply hard and inconvenient. You would have to install Python, and Python is particularly bad on Windows (UX wise). Here came the Eask to be the savior. It\u0026rsquo;s compatible with Cask\u0026rsquo;s DSL and ensures the workflow\u0026rsquo;s consistency (no Python). Hopefully, everyone can use Eask to develop their elisp packages. Maybe someday Emacs can live better under the Windows\u0026hellip; What do you think?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also learned Hugo; would love to share it one day!\n🔗 Links https://github.com/emacs-eask/eask ","permalink":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"-introduction\"\u003e🔰 Introduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name \u003ccode\u003eEask\u003c/code\u003e came from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cask/cask\"\u003eEmacs Cask\u003c/a\u003e\n; if you already know what \u003ccode\u003eCask\u003c/code\u003e is and what it does, please skip this and\nforward to the next section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ccode\u003eCask\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eEask\u003c/code\u003e are interchangeable in this section)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eEask\u003c/code\u003e is the dependency management tool for Emacs Lisp.

That I have heard of a lot of people asking me how to make a library for other people to use?\nBuilding a tool is hard and time-consuming.

Attention, learn design pattern is to learn how to build a better software architecture. Not to learn how to use a design pattern in your code! I have seen programmers use design pattern all the time and feel bad about it because they seem to be attempt to use design pattern instead of designing a software architecture.\nOnce you have the skill and knowledge of design pattern. I would recommend seeing how other people build their tools on any open source platform.

Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine. In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying \u0026ldquo;Data Structure\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Algorithms\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Design Patterns\u0026rdquo;. What I presume that Design Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc.\nOn top of these concepts, this is the third framework I built. I could not remember what I built for the previous two framworks. I presume that I have some knowledge about building a framework, library, etc. At the beginning of the JCSUnity development process, I have had studied the basis of the game engine architecture but not quite fully understand the Unity Engine itself. For instance, Unity Engine\u0026rsquo;s Scripting API, and some controls specific for Unity Eninge. Because of this, you might realized some of the code or design are a bit fiddle and inconsistent.\nWhen I am writing this article, the framework itself has been developed to the state that is convoluted and hard to maintain. Within this framework, there are around 400 to 500 scripts, most of the scripts are self executed which mean a script is a component that could run by it own. By this idea, one Self-Runnable Script benefits the design and increase the variation possibility but it also brings the cost of unnecessary performance.\nIntroduction JCSUnity is a component driven framework built to allow users to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics or features. The architecture design of JCSUnity come alone to Unity Engine\u0026rsquo;s design, which makes the framework highly compatible with Unity Engine itself. Every time the Unity Engine release an update, there should not be any issues to JCSUnity. This framework increases the productivity of game developers and enhances the game development process. Base my own experiences, the game originally that would spend my 15 weeks, I could compress development time to around 3 to 4 weeks. JCSUnity has most of the game presets that Unity Engine does not usually provide. For instance, switch scene with fade in and out, background music player, automatically adjust the screen to aspect ratio, etc. With all these presets, allow the game developers are more likely can be more focus on the design of the game instead of worrying all these trivial features.\nSelf-Runnable Script Therefore, what is Self-Runnable Script? For example, here is a list of three SRSs.\n1. Circle Action 2. Shake Effect 3. Wave Action Above example scripts are all self-runnable without any dependencies and will not influence to each other scripts. Base on this design patterns, how many unique behaviours if we make all these scripts interact with each other?\n7 behaviours = 3 basic behaviours + (Circle Action + Shake Effect) + (Circle Action + Wave Action) + (Shake Effect + Wave Effect) + (Circle Action + Shake Effect + Wave Action) I presume if anyone who has the necessary knowledge about game engine architecture. Design the components this way could avoid decoupling between the scripts, and added the flexibility to the designers. Designers are no longer limit to specific design; they can test and play with each component easily. The side effects are this could cost a lot of additional performance and memory usage.\n3 Basic Actions 本身3種 (Circle Action 繞圓 + Shake Effect 震動) + (Circle Action 繞圓 + Wave Action 上下搖擺) + (Shake Effect 震動 + Wave Effect 上下搖擺) (Circle Action 繞圓 + Shake Effect 震動 + Wave Action 上下搖擺) Scripting Design Having the script design this way, there should be a script principle so people could contribute or extend to the project easier.

I am just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my Emacs and Vim repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs.\nLead to the conclusion; I use Emacs more often than Vim. Before Vim users left the website, I would like to hold onto the basis, why I chose Emacs for my most frequently used text editor. First and foremost, I organized the editor users into two groups. Base on my own experiences, people who use Emacs are most likely work in the software development industry. On the other hand, the majority of Vim users works either in cybersecurity or a free hacker. The reasons are pretty much straightforward, as a software engineer, I would much appreciate Emacs\u0026rsquo; design. Emacs\u0026rsquo; architecture brings a lot more spaces and flexibilities to the software development workflow, and it maximizes the changing possibilities to the software engineer. Most of the software development is most likely to stay in a program that could likeliest achieve most of the tasks. Does it sound familiar to you? Yes, it is just another way of saying the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Of course, Vim could possibly do what Emacs does, extends to Vim\u0026rsquo;s original design, I found that conflict Vim is an editor design for fast editing file in terminal. Comparing the two editors, Emacs had been built the way what software developer wants; Vim would most likely lose in this battle on this aspect. Vice versa, Vim are very popular to those who do not need an IDE to do their job and often require to exit text editor to jump to other software, do not even argues that Vim is moving towards to Emacs\u0026rsquo; design. Well, this leads to a problem that I could not find a good reason for having the conflict between the original design fast editing file in terminal and having multiple plugins or configurations in Vim. Though, if Vim starts moving towards to Emacs\u0026rsquo;s design, does that mean Vim will lose the advantage on fast editing file in terminal? Many of Vim users complains Emacs was too big and cost so much of its\u0026rsquo; starting time, but now they want more plugins or configurations to their Vim settings? Emacs was designed between the lightweight text editor and heavyweight IDE, resulting Emacs could not going to be faster than Vim on the starting time, but it brings benefits to people who will like a \u0026rsquo;lightweight IDE\u0026rsquo;, it retains most functionalities from any IDE, or even better, program yourself one!\nIf Emacs is that good why still not many people using it? The reason could be straightforward, I learned Emacs from scratch without any in-between supports like Spacemacs or Doom-emacs. I found that Emacs main website is not that friendly compared to other many sites. Plus, you could barely saw videos online that are about Emacs. Furthermore, compares to Vim\u0026rsquo;s shortcuts design, Emacs have less cognitive shortcuts consequent people having a hard time learning Emacs\u0026rsquo; shortcuts comparing learning Vim\u0026rsquo;s shortcuts. I would doubt anyone would likely to learn Emacs by having all these kind of challenges or difficulties in front of them. The learning curve is steep, and the cost of learning a new language for editing Emacs\u0026rsquo; configuration, which is EmacsLisp, could be an extra cost of time. If you notice programming language Lisp, then maybe this would be too obscure to you. In my case, I have no experience with programming language Lisp which leads me many hassles while learning EmacsLisp. I have been using Emacs for 4 years, and I still could not say that I am an expert to Emacs. I am not trying to, and I reckon developing routine is most likely imperative comparing to fixing the editor\u0026rsquo;s configuration.\nLastly, I would say these are just my personal experiences; this means all of these are just my subjective thoughts. Some could be right, and some could be wrong. Emacs have its\u0026rsquo; own benefits, which Vim also does. I often use Vim editing files while I connect to the remote server. Indeed, one more advantage to Vim is that Vim is pre-installed on the most system. This lead to the conclusion that there is no best editor, the only wise man knows how to use the right tool on the right circumstance.\n","permalink":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-vs-vim/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePrecisely that I am neither an Emacs nor Vim expert.

I believed text editor is just tool to help programmer make a software and get their job done.\nAt my previous post ' Framework I have been working\u0026hellip; (Part 2) \u0026rsquo; I mentioned I watched a few episodes of ' Handmade Hero \u0026rsquo;s series. Casey Muratori was using Emacs as a text editor coding C/C++(I think now he use 4coder instead of Emacs). I was surprised by how fast he can code in Emacs. So I made some research and discovered there is Vim which is another great text editor competing with Emacs. I decide to give both editor a try, and it turn out I chose Emacs over Vim.\nFirst, I would like to talk about why I chose Emacs over Vim. I think Emacs can do almost everything that Vim does. Vim stays cool he just wants to be a text editor and does not want to do something else. Emacs design the way that you could turn Emacs from text editor to something else. And of course, Emacs is not perfect. Emacs has few troubles doing something like you still need to use third-party software in order to run a package, and sometimes Emacs just froze when I am just trying to edit a text file. Emacs is just a right tool for me because I use to want a text editor that could edit any programming languages and do anything inside it. On the other hand, you might say that is gross to have a text editor do all kind of job for you. Why do not we just use another program instead of code in elisp and write your own functionality for Emacs? Is that even worth it?\nThe answer is really depend on who is using it. For me, I program in different programming languages; I would somehow need to use other text editor or IDE when I change to code in another programming language. For example, I code Java and C++ I would have to change from \u0026lsquo;Eclipse\u0026rsquo;/\u0026lsquo;Android Studio\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Visual Studio\u0026rsquo;/\u0026lsquo;MonoDevelop\u0026rsquo;. And these IDEs has different key bindings, which I really hate because I would somehow make mistakes by pressing the wrong key binding from previous IDE to current IDE. In this case, Emacs/Vim become useful because I could finally code all programming languages with the same key bindings. On the other hand, if you are a front-end developer you would recommend people use Sublime Text instead of Emacs because it is wasting your time and is not worth it anymore.\n* My emacs file config repo * url: https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs * Few Videos I watched when I learn Emacs * Casy\u0026rsquo;s Emacs Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbmV1bnQ-i0\u0026t=1584s Stop Worrying and Love Emacs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc ","permalink":"https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/best-editor-ever/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFirst the foremost, this article is all subjective opinions\nby me, and there are all kind of text editor for any kind of\nprogrammer.

It sounds straightforward to make your tools or library, but when you start making it, it actually kind of hard to make. That I have heard of a lot of people asking me how to make a library for other people to use?\nBuilding a tool is hard and time-consuming. The first thing to make your tool is to have learned Design Pattern (I have already mentioned few books I recommend in my previous post - ' Framework I have been working\u0026hellip; (Part 1) \u0026lsquo;). Attention, learn design pattern is to learn how to build a better software architecture. Not to learn how to use a design pattern in your code! I have seen programmers use design pattern all the time and feel bad about it because they seem to be attempt to use design pattern instead of designing a software architecture.\nOnce you have the skill and knowledge of design pattern. I would recommend seeing how other people build their tools on any open source platform.

Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity.\nBecause for whole semester I was so stressful, so I did not remember much what I did for the class in details. In fact, I did everything except the art for the project. It was fun and I did learn three things from this class.\nNever repeat yourself. (Duplicate code) Design Patterns. New technology is dangerous. Never repeat yourself, and the duplicate code is a significant part to be a good programmer Because duplicate code will cause copy and paste everywhere around the place. In architecture wise, copy and pasting the code everywhere is not a good structure and it could cause an issue if the program gets huge enough that you could not maintain the whole software. I am not saying I made the duplicate on this project, but what does annoying me is that I have nearly created everything the same over and over again in each project I have made from scratch. For instance, a scene manager could probably create for all kind of game because what kind of game does not need to switch a scene? Even a bad game will still need to switch scene from menu to gameplay.\nDesign Patterns is the key for extreme programming and maintainability for software architecture. Prevent duplicate code is also the topic include from the design patterns. I would recommand people read \u0026lsquo;Head First Design Pattern\u0026rsquo; that are written by Eric Freeman and Elisabth Robson. The example code was written in Java and as everyone knows that Java is a good programming language when people need to explain OOP concepts.\nOtherwise, there is another option book \u0026lsquo;Design Patterns\u0026rsquo; written by a bunch of good C++ programmers, for people who feel more comfortable with using C++ than using Java.\nAt this time, one of my instructor [Billy Garban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billylemonzest/) from Academy of Art University suggests me to watch [Handmade Hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive) series that host by [Casey Muratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori) . I have watched a few episodes what make me impressive is how he can teach people in such a way that everyone could understand, including me. I like when he talks about what makes him special is his productivity to the company. (I will discuss a bit more 'productivity' in another post.) This changes me think differently instead of just thinking about algorithm and data structure. What makes you different than other programmers? Then I realize, being productive is important and advance as a programmer. Then I figure out that how to make myself productive as much as possible is to write your own tool. The reason is simple, the majority of people that are not programmer might think of the most time programmer did is to type the program itself, but I believe this is a huge mistake. In fact, the time spending on thinking is way more than time spent on actually typing. So writing your own tool is saving your time when you think.\nHere is a list of some frameworks or libraries that I have created for my own use during my college years. All of them have a different purpose, and some of them were written in various programming language. These are also the evidence that these tools did save me a lot of time when doing my school work.

I\u0026rsquo;m very pessimistic, give up things quickly, and not knowing how to be persistent. Wonder where are the differences between success and failure. Maybe I do have gifts for doing things right, but not for long. When I grew up a little, I\u0026rsquo;m already at the bottom of the class. I usually couldn\u0026rsquo;t be proud of myself especially when you have brothers and sisters that they often did things better than you. Util to the day first year of middle school, my life of concepts has a drastic change; my grade stays at the average rate, but instead of focusing on grades, my parent chose to have me entered the athletic class in tennis rather than the regular class. I felt motivated about sports comparing to coursework. During spartan training from our coaches, plus my innate health doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any advantages to make me successful in tennis. I finally got my first specialty by been through all the rigorous training. Form this experience; I learned the importance of being persistent, sometime you couldn\u0026rsquo;t care for all the possibilities, and confidence.\nLast year of the middle school years, I went back to the regular class. I decide to challenge something that I was always trying to avoid, studying. In the beginning, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy for me by doing something that isn\u0026rsquo;t that interesting. In a certain opportunity, I get to know some thoughts about life, which are \u0026ldquo;Life aren\u0026rsquo;t always happy.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;In some aspect, no one like to study.\u0026rdquo;.

Although this could not be enough to be like the top 3 in our school, this makes me comprehend somethings that are way more important than the grade. \u0026ldquo;Exertion wouldn\u0026rsquo;t betray you.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Knowing the taste of success, would make you feel omnipotent.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are a lot of things that happened in high school. The truths are that not everything goes perfectly throughout my life. During my high school life is my first time getting bullied at school, not physically but metaphysically. I reckon because I was too proud and aggressive at that time and I argued all the subtleties and most of the time I was right. Consequent that being always right does not mean success in real life. I was in despair about the reality and learned some significant lessons, not arguing so much and be humble.\nAfter the worst part of my life, I started to get in touch with people carefully. I attempted to learn how to talk to people and endeavored to be modest. I would like to search for my equanimity at any time and face things more mature.\nMy life wasn\u0026rsquo;t going smooth all the time; I underwent both pleasing and hurtful part of my life.
