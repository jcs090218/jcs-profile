My personal website.

See the latest version in https://jcs090218.github.io/jcs-profile/.

## üî® Development

To start the server:

```
$ hugo server
```

Then open the url http://localhost:1313/ to your browser!

## ‚ùì How to deploy?

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is a note for myself.**

The static files are under `gh-pages`; hence, you need to switch to that branch to deploy on your website.

```sh
# Navigate to the static sites folder!
$ cd /path/to/public

# Then pull all static files under public directory!
$ git clone https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-profile . --branch gh-pages
```

Every time the files are updated, you need to wait for the workflow to complete before you pull it on your server.
