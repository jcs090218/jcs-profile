      <title>Problem with LeetCode and SWE jobs</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/problem-with-leetcode-and-swe-jobs/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rant about software engineering interviews and &lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/&#34;&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-preamble&#34;&gt;üóØÔ∏è Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are grinding through &lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/&#34;&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to break into the tech industry, drawn by the high salaries it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-what-does-leetcode-actually-bring&#34;&gt;ü§î What does LeetCode actually bring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/&#34;&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt; offers little more than these benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm&#34;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/a&gt; exercises and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure&#34;&gt;data structure&lt;/a&gt; knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding under pressure (Why though? Are we in a war zone now?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing coding interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, completing &lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/&#34;&gt;LeetCode&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t prove you&amp;rsquo;re a good software engineer.
It only shows you can code basic algorithms and solve programming puzzles.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t test essential skills like collaboration, communication, documentation, design patterns, system architecture, low-level programming, or core computer science knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being 10x engineer in my first job</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/career/being-10x-engineer-in-my-first-job/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across a post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkedin.com/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; with the eye-catching title, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve met a 10x engineer.‚Äù
But as I read through the post, I started to have doubts. The author described how one of their colleagues had
managed to fix a bunch of complex bugs in a short amount of time, which left them in awe. ü§î&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that really what defines a 10x engineer? It brought back memories of my own experience as a so-called 10x engineer during my &lt;strong&gt;first job&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elisp Language Server</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve recently created a language server for Emacs Lisp. It‚Äôs interesting
since people don‚Äôt think a language server for Emacs Lisp will provide
any value. The statement is correct, and so do I. Emacs Lisp is only used
within the Emacs editor, and Emacs itself is an Emacs Lisp interpreter.
Therefore, a language server for Emacs Lisp would hardly bring any benefits
to Emacs users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But imagine you can code elisp (short for Emacs Lisp) outside of Emacs.
That sounds interesting, huh? ü§î&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to build your own ELPA with Eask?</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/build-elpa/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/build-elpa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA&#34;&gt;ELPA&lt;/a&gt; stands for Emacs Lisp Package Archive. It&amp;rsquo;s used for Emacs users
to download packages from, and it&amp;rsquo;s also the place where Emacs Lisp developers
will host their packages. Here is a list of famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA&#34;&gt;ELPA&lt;/a&gt;; see their site
for more information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://elpa.gnu.org/&#34;&gt;GNU Elpa&lt;/a&gt; (official)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://elpa.nongnu.org/&#34;&gt;NonGNU Elpa&lt;/a&gt; (official)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://melpa.org/#/&#34;&gt;MELPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-why&#34;&gt;‚ùì Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we want to host our own ELPA? Aren‚Äôt those ELPAs enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, in general, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to host ELPA yourself since most packages
you need will be available in one of those ELPA (packages can co-exist
between ELPA). Here are several reasons why you might want to build
your own ELPA:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first VSCode plugin</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug 23rd, 2023. I&amp;rsquo;ve created my first VSCode plugin &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shader-ls/vscode-shader&#34;&gt;vscode-shader&lt;/a&gt;.
My intention was simple: to create a language server&amp;rsquo;s client in VSCode
for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shader-ls/shader-language-server&#34;&gt;shader-language-server&lt;/a&gt; that I created a couple of months ago. ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;-simple-and-good-ux&#34;&gt;üî∞ Simple and good UX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is very simple to develop a VSCode plugin.
Especially developing a language server&amp;rsquo;s client for VSCode.
There are many examples and good documentation on their site,
making it very easy for developers. I am using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai&#34;&gt;uniteai&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emacs-grammarly/grammarly-language-server&#34;&gt;grammarly-language-server&lt;/a&gt; as the references.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 30th, 2023. I have created my first language server that is actually
useful to someone. I tried a language server a while back, but it was just
an example server, so it‚Äôs not very useful, and it‚Äôs only for educational
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target language I chose to write is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Reference.html&#34;&gt;ShaderLab&lt;/a&gt; language.
ShaderLab is used in Unity Engine, so you can write custom shaders
to stylize your game. Unlike regular programming languages, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Reference.html&#34;&gt;ShaderLab&lt;/a&gt;
is much simpler to analyze, so the language server can respond to the
client side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Long Journey with Emacs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ö†Ô∏è The intention of this post is to remind myself why Emacs isn&amp;rsquo;t worth my time anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Emacs since 2015. I have developed more than 150 elisp packages,
and maintained over 200 packages (including my packages). It&amp;rsquo;s been a long
journey staying in the Emacs community, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good for me to slow
myself down and step back a little and think what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished through
out these years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs Eask 101 - Build tool</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask-101/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask-101/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve developed more than 50 elisp packages, and maintain 100 or more of them.
Developing an elisp package isn&amp;rsquo;t easy for a beginner, especially for those
who want to publish their package to an ELPA. e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://elpa.gnu.org/&#34;&gt;GNU Elpa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://elpa.nongnu.org/&#34;&gt;NonGNU Elpa&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://melpa.org/&#34;&gt;MELPA&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli&#34;&gt;Eask&lt;/a&gt; to help me develop elisp packages. Therefore, in this
article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach people how to use this tool to help you build your
own elisp packages! üòÑ&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fastest ELPA</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/fastest-elpa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the fastest ELPA? Let&amp;rsquo;s define it first! The ELPA runs the fastest? No,
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. The ELPA serves you the fastest? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition for fastest ELPA in this article means it builds your packages
the fastest! You might wonder why and how! Let me explain it to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal ELPA, like MELPA, builds packages from the &lt;code&gt;recipes&lt;/code&gt; directory, so it
takes O(n) to do so. The more packages one ELPA holds, take longer the time to
get packages to update to the server. The general solution is to use a more
powerful PC to reduce the build time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always been using AWS as my main web hosting choice. But I
have come to the point that I reckon the price and services aren&amp;rsquo;t
something that I need. Therefore, I have decided to switch to another
web hosting company just for another taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reasons are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS charges you money when you click on their services without
notifying the user. I dislike how it functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The price is too high, plus I don&amp;rsquo;t really need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI is awful, and UX is bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jargons aren&amp;rsquo;t transferable (I&amp;rsquo;m picky)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s move into details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Timeline is placed in summer time, middle of July 2022, one of my friend
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/henrykuh&#34;&gt;@henrykuh&lt;/a&gt;) invited me to join the Game
Jam that he is going to host in Aug 2022. In the meantime, he has also
invited me to rejoin the community &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MatchWorkshop&#34;&gt;MatchWorkshop&lt;/a&gt;
, and become the headmaster of the Game Programming deparetment.
Therefore, this Game Jam is treated as an opportunity to collaborate
with other headmaster from other department in this community. üòï&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs Eask - Alternative to Emacs Cask</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;-introduction&#34;&gt;üî∞ Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;code&gt;Eask&lt;/code&gt; came from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cask/cask&#34;&gt;Emacs Cask&lt;/a&gt;
; if you already know what &lt;code&gt;Cask&lt;/code&gt; is and what it does, please skip this and
forward to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Cask&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Eask&lt;/code&gt; are interchangeable in this section)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Eask&lt;/code&gt; is the dependency management tool for Emacs Lisp. It&amp;rsquo;s like &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;Node.js&lt;/code&gt;; but it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the same since &lt;code&gt;Eask&lt;/code&gt; has fewer tools than &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;,
plus their ecosystems are slightly different. Below is the link &lt;strong&gt;Why Cask?&lt;/strong&gt; has
a better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First static site generator</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/web-dev/first-static-site-generator/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/web-dev/first-static-site-generator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m recently hooked by the static site generator, hence I have decided to create
one for myself. Why not? The huge reason is that I could host the site using
the GitHub&amp;rsquo;s static site hosting services, but the one I have previously created
in 2018 &lt;a href=&#34;https://jcs090218.github.io/blog/2018/11/12/Legacy%20-%20%E8%88%8A%E6%96%87/API-Reference-Template%20-%20API%E5%8F%83%E8%80%83%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF/&#34;&gt;API-Reference-Template&lt;/a&gt;.
is server base, which is not generator base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The static site generator isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to create, the most valuable technology
is the frontend and UI/UX. However, I have already created the frontend for
my own use. The main task for me would just have to extract the server base
to generator base. I have also renamed the tool to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SiraDoc/SiraDoc&#34;&gt;SiraDoc&lt;/a&gt;,
so then I&amp;rsquo;m able to use it for other sites as well! Just like the previous
website, yet a lot easier and more suitable for the GitHub Actions&amp;rsquo; environment!

is also the biggest obstacle for me as well. Personal license (free version) of
Unity will expire in a period of time depends on your region. The licensing system
from Unity is partially contradict to the CI/CD concept since it will force
the user to update their secret &lt;code&gt;UNITY_LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; on their GitHub Actions. (Notice
this does not apply to Plus/Pro users because they use a different licensing system!)

of it. This may be a process; afraid makes us strong and a much more
experienced people. Humans suppose to grow like that! So let it be!
Once you are afraid of something, don&amp;rsquo;t give up on trying it; think
about the issue, think as hard as you can, and try to resolve it!
Even if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the issue, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we are bad,
or the issue can&amp;rsquo;t be resolved in the later future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Productivity is topic that often is ignored by a lot programmer. I have
seen a bunch of documents out there talking about algorithm and data structure,
so I would like to post a topic about productivity for an advanced programmer
or for the programmer who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly
mean productivity in software development field? If you have seen my previous
blog post &#39;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When get started to the game development, people will somehow face some sort
of situation that they will need to determine what they are going to master
to do in the development. The game development are mainly split into three
careers, which are &amp;lsquo;Art&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Design&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;Programming&amp;rsquo;. These three jobs are
very different to one the other. The best method to figure it out what you
want to do is to try all them all out one at a time. If your situation would
not allow you to do so,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many of my works are about making API. I always have their trouble making
API documents for myself and for people to read what each API does. To
resolve this issue, I spent a few hours to design a small website that I
could drop the HTML file in the target folder and it will show the file on
the website. The following list is the list of technologies I used in the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the final project from the first class of web development from our
school. I joined this class as an elective class so I could have a peek of how
web development works. A list below is few highlights I would like to show from
this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallax Effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of Sound&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-parallax-effect&#34;&gt;üëÅÔ∏è Parallax Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most parallax effect I have seen aren&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfied to me. Generally they
will have a image at the back of other components then have it semi-stationary
to sit still at the place. In this project I would like to have a peek of how
CSS can do on 2016. Fortunately, after being learning animation system from
CSS I am for sure that the parallax effect I was to imagine are possible to
accomplish by just the CSS without using JavaScript. You can use the small
panel on the top left corner to navigate through the four pages from this website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a introduction of how JCSUnity does for the game data save/load system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are main three ways that you could do &lt;code&gt;saving&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt; in Unity
Engine with C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;acknowledge&#34;&gt;Acknowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my
college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have
much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I
decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years
and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity
Engine. In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying
&amp;ldquo;Data Structure&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Design Patterns&amp;rdquo;. What I presume that Design
Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built
by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a
lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires
that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment
have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET
Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs vs Vim</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-vs-vim/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Precisely that I am neither an Emacs nor Vim expert. I am
just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just
amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-vim&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;
repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold
onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there
are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid
changing the configuration to my editor. Only because I am
not going to remake the wheel, indeed, I am not going judge
either Emacs over Vim or Vim over Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Editor Ever</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First the foremost, this article is all subjective opinions
by me, and there are all kind of text editor for any kind of
programmer. I think some programmer have some kind of religion,
so I am not going to tell anyone to use any particular text
editor. I believed text editor is just tool to help programmer
make a software and get their job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my previous post &#39;

&amp;rsquo; I mentioned I watched a few episodes of &#39;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive&#34;&gt;Handmade Hero&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;rsquo;s series.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cmuratori&#34;&gt;Casey Muratori&lt;/a&gt;
was using Emacs as a text editor coding C/C++(I think now he use 4coder instead of Emacs). I was surprised by how fast he can code in Emacs. So I made some research and discovered there is Vim which is another great text editor competing with Emacs. I decide to give both editor a try, and it turn out I chose Emacs over Vim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Productivity is topic that often is ignored by a lot programmer. I have
seen a bunch of documents out there talking about algorithm and data structure,
so I would like to post a topic about productivity for an advanced programmer
or for the programmer who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly
mean productivity in software development field? If you have seen my previous
blog post &#39;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jcs-profile.com/?page=Framework_sp_I_sp_have_sp_been_sp_working_sp_-Part_sp_1-&#34;&gt;Framework I have been working&amp;hellip; (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story start when I have difficulty when I was working inside one of
our class in college. It is a collaborative class that all kind of experts
work on the same project, and of course for game development students we
decide to make a AR game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the dream always big and great, but when it get into reality it always
not going to be fun, especially when you are making a game and work in the game
industry. Game is a hard thing to work on , both on the programming side and
the art side. All members in the group will just get stressful every day and
every week. Plus when you know that you are the only programmer in the team, I
think this could be really stressful. I would just admit I stress out the first
day of class despite I already have some experience using the game engine Unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of talking about myself. Primarily I&amp;rsquo;m nobody, not phenomenal,
and never been onto news or other media, not any of those. Is hard to think
that who will spend their precious time reading this &amp;lsquo;About Me&amp;rsquo; article. I
would desire not to write a verbose introduction about myself. I&amp;rsquo;m currently
24; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that I lived long, but long enough for me to review my
past few years of living and consider what&amp;rsquo;s the future path I&amp;rsquo;m going to
step in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have heard about people saying that writing a blog is a good idea. And
here is it, I am going to write a development blog for myself. I have been
coding for years and would like to share what I had been through and talk
about more like what I think is significants to a programmer. What are the
jobs and tasks to the programmer and what does programmer does?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
