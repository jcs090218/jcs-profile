      <title>Elisp Language Server</title>

I‚Äôve recently created a language server for Emacs Lisp. It‚Äôs interesting since people don‚Äôt think a language server for Emacs Lisp will provide any value. The statement is correct, and so do I. Emacs Lisp is only used within the Emacs editor, and Emacs itself is an Emacs Lisp interpreter. Therefore, a language server for Emacs Lisp would hardly bring any benefits to Emacs users.
But imagine you can code elisp (short for Emacs Lisp) outside of Emacs.</description>

      <title>How to build your own ELPA with Eask?</title>

      <description>ELPA stands for Emacs Lisp Package Archive. It&amp;rsquo;s used for Emacs users to download packages from, and it&amp;rsquo;s also the place where Emacs Lisp developers will host their packages. Here is a list of famous ELPA; see their site for more information!
GNU Elpa (official) NonGNU Elpa (official) MELPA ‚ùì Why? So why do we want to host our own ELPA? Aren‚Äôt those ELPAs enough?
Yes, in general, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to host ELPA yourself since most packages you need will be available in one of those ELPA (packages can co-exist between ELPA).</description>

Aug 23rd, 2023. I&amp;rsquo;ve created my first VSCode plugin &amp;ndash; vscode-shader. My intention was simple: to create a language server&amp;rsquo;s client in VSCode for my shader-language-server that I created a couple of months ago. ü§î
üî∞ Simple and good UX First of all, it is very simple to develop a VSCode plugin. Especially developing a language server&amp;rsquo;s client for VSCode. There are many examples and good documentation on their site, making it very easy for developers.</description>

April 30th, 2023. I have created my first language server that is actually useful to someone. I tried a language server a while back, but it was just an example server, so it‚Äôs not very useful, and it‚Äôs only for educational purposes.
The target language I chose to write is the ShaderLab language. ShaderLab is used in Unity Engine, so you can write custom shaders to stylize your game.</description>

      <title>Long Journey with Emacs</title>

      <description>‚ö†Ô∏è The intention of this post is to remind myself why Emacs isn&amp;rsquo;t worth my time anymore.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Emacs since 2015. I have developed more than 150 elisp packages, and maintained over 200 packages (including my packages). It&amp;rsquo;s been a long journey staying in the Emacs community, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good for me to slow myself down and step back a little and think what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished through out these years.</description>

      <title>Emacs Eask 101 - Build tool</title>

      <guid>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask-101/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve developed more than 50 elisp packages, and maintain 100 or more of them. Developing an elisp package isn&amp;rsquo;t easy for a beginner, especially for those who want to publish their package to an ELPA. e.g., GNU Elpa, NonGNU Elpa, MELPA, etc.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I use Eask to help me develop elisp packages. Therefore, in this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach people how to use this tool to help you build your own elisp packages!</description>

      <title>Fastest ELPA</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/fastest-elpa/</link>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the fastest ELPA? Let&amp;rsquo;s define it first! The ELPA runs the fastest? No, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. The ELPA serves you the fastest? Maybe.
The definition for fastest ELPA in this article means it builds your packages the fastest! You might wonder why and how! Let me explain it to you!
Normal ELPA, like MELPA, builds packages from the recipes directory, so it takes O(n) to do so. The more packages one ELPA holds, take longer the time to get packages to update to the server.</description>

      <description>I have always been using AWS as my main web hosting choice. But I have come to the point that I reckon the price and services aren&amp;rsquo;t something that I need. Therefore, I have decided to switch to another web hosting company just for another taste.
The main reasons are listed below:
AWS charges you money when you click on their services without notifying the user. I dislike how it functions.</description>

      <title>Emacs Eask - Alternative to Emacs Cask</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/editor/emacs-eask/</guid>
      <description>üî∞ Introduction The name Eask came from Emacs Cask ; if you already know what Cask is and what it does, please skip this and forward to the next section.
(NOTE: Cask and Eask are interchangeable in this section)
Eask is the dependency management tool for Emacs Lisp. It&amp;rsquo;s like npm to Node.js; but it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the same since Eask has fewer tools than npm, plus their ecosystems are slightly different.</description>

      <title>First static site generator</title>
      <link>https://www.jcs-profile.com/posts/web-dev/first-static-site-generator/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m recently hooked by the static site generator, hence I have decided to create one for myself. Why not? The huge reason is that I could host the site using the GitHub&amp;rsquo;s static site hosting services, but the one I have previously created in 2018 API-Reference-Template. is server base, which is not generator base.
The static site generator isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to create, the most valuable technology is the frontend and UI/UX.</description>

is also the biggest obstacle for me as well. Personal license (free version) of
Unity will expire in a period of time depends on your region. The licensing system
from Unity is partially contradict to the CI/CD concept since it will force
the user to update their secret &lt;code&gt;UNITY_LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; on their GitHub Actions. (Notice
this does not apply to Plus/Pro users because they use a different licensing system!)

The talked was, 2020-05-06
While you are in a dilemma, we humans are totally normal to be afraid of it. This may be a process; afraid makes us strong and a much more experienced people. Humans suppose to grow like that! So let it be! Once you are afraid of something, don&amp;rsquo;t give up on trying it; think about the issue, think as hard as you can, and try to resolve it!</description>

I have seen a bunch of documents out there talking about algorithm and data structure, so I would like to post a topic about productivity for an advanced programmer or for the programmer who wants to be a better programmer.

      <description>When get started to the game development, people will somehow face some sort of situation that they will need to determine what they are going to master to do in the development. The game development are mainly split into three careers, which are &amp;lsquo;Art&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Design&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;Programming&amp;rsquo;. These three jobs are very different to one the other. The best method to figure it out what you want to do is to try all them all out one at a time.</description>

Many of my works are about making API. I always have their trouble making API documents for myself and for people to read what each API does. To resolve this issue, I spent a few hours to design a small website that I could drop the HTML file in the target folder and it will show the file on the website. The following list is the list of technologies I used in the project.</description>

Acknowledge I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine.</description>

      <description>Precisely that I am neither an Emacs nor Vim expert. I am just an amateur that knows about the two editors with just amount of knowledge. If you check out two of my Emacs and Vim repo, this could be the worst experience of all time. I hold onto an idea that the editors are just a tool. Unless there are issues that hamper or paster my workflow, I will avoid changing the configuration to my editor.</description>

I think some programmer have some kind of religion, so I am not going to tell anyone to use any particular text editor. I believed text editor is just tool to help programmer make a software and get their job done.

I&amp;rsquo;m currently 24; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that I lived long, but long enough for me to review my past few years of living and consider what&amp;rsquo;s the future path I&amp;rsquo;m going to step in.</description>
